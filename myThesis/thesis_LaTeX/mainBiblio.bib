abstract = {Time Series Analysis With Applications in R, Second Edition, presents an accessible approach to understanding time series models and their applications. Although the emphasis is on time domain ARIMA models and their analysis, the new edition devotes two chapters to the frequency domain and three to time series regression models, models for heteroscedasticty, and threshold models. All of the ideas and methods are illustrated with both real and simulated data sets. A unique feature of this edition is its integration with the R computing environment. The tables and graphical displays are accompanied by the R commands used to produce them. An extensive R package, TSA, which contains many new or revised R functions and all of the data used in the book, accompanies the written text. Script files of R commands for each chapter are available for download. There is also an extensive appendix in the book that leads the reader through the use of R commands and the new R package to carry out the analyses.},

abstract = {In this study, a new type of fiber-based mechanomyography (MMG) sensor was developed and used as a motion on/off trigger sensor for a lower limb rehabilitation exoskeleton (LLRE). Piezoelectric material, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), was applied to fabricate a MMG sensor, using the near-field electrospinning technology to electrically spin PVDF fibers to ∼5-10 $\mu$m in diameter. PVDF fibers attached on an interdigitated (IDT) electrode with different pole pairs and interspaces were packaged into a MMG sensor. This MMG sensor was stuck on the thigh muscles to detect and acquire human motion intention signal, then trigger the controller and actuate the LLRE. The LLRE multi-axis control system included a master and four slave controllers. The master controller released the command signal to control the slave controllers via controller area network (CAN). A multi-axis control system was developed to actuate the joints of hips and knees of both legs by the LLRE. In the study, commercial electromyography (EMG) sensors were also to compare with the as-made MMG sensors. Results showed that the maximum signal amplitude of the commercail EMG sensor was about ∼0.2 V, whereas the MMG sensor was about ∼2.8 V. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EMG was about ∼4, while that of MMG was about ∼25. From physiological signals captured from the MMG sensor for the human walking with the LLRE, this new sensor improved the sensitivity in driving the LLRE.},

Despite enormous efforts devoted to explore applications of electrospun nanofibers, such as separation, catalysis, nanoelectronics, sensors, energy conversion/storage, and biomedical utilization, there are limited attempts to employ these nanofibers for reinforcement in polymer composites. Electrospun nanofibers, however, possess comprehensive advantages not typically shared by other nanoscale composite fillers/reinforcing agents, such as continuity, diverse material choice, controlled diameter/structure, possible alignment/assembly, mass production capability and so forth. Therefore electrospun nanofibers have great potential as promising reinforcement fillers for next-generation polymer composites. This is a comprehensive and state-of-the-art review of the latest advances made in development of electrospun nanofiber reinforced polymer composite materials with intention to stimulate interests in both academia and industry.},

Urban vegetable production is therefore a response to the available market demand and the challenges of unemployment and food insecurity resulting from the urbanisation. The study examined the contribution of urban vegetable production to farmers' livelihoods in the Kumasi Metropolis of Ashanti Region of Ghana. Descriptive survey design was used for the study. Based on a simple random sampling technique, 300 urban vegetable farmers were selected and interviewed. Cronbach alpha coefficient values showed high reliability and consistency of the farmers' livelihood subscales. The study that the contribution of urban vegetable production to farmers' livelihoods differed significantly regarding different livelihood subscales (ANOVA). Post-hoc multiple comparisons test (Dunnett's T3) result revealed that the contribution of urban vegetable production to farmers' mean livelihoods was generally 'low'. However, it contributed 'moderately high' to their natural and physical capitals. The strength of association between farmers' mean livelihood subscales also showed that urban vegetable production impacted differently and significantly on their livelihoods. It is recommended that Farmer Based Organisations (FBOs) should be formed to help empower and protect farmers' from the exploitation of prospective buyers. It would also help address common challenges confronting members including high input cost, lack of credit facilities and inadequate marketing avenues.},

abstract = {Since ancient times, plasmonic structural coloring has inspired humanity; glassmakers achieved vibrant colors by doping glass with metal nanoparticles to craft beautiful objects such as the Roman Lycurgus cup and stained glass. These lovely color filtering effects are a consequence of the resonant coupling of light and free electrons in metal nanoparticles, known as surface plasmons. Thanks to the continuing improvement of nanofabrication technology, the dimensions of nanoparticles and structures can now be precisely engineered to form "optical nanoantennas," allowing for control of optical response at an unprecedented level. Recently, the field of plasmonic structural coloring has seen extensive growth. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of various plasmonic color filtering approaches and highlight their uses in a broad palette of applications. Various surface plasmon resonance modes employed in the plasmonic color filtering effect are discussed. We first review the development of the pioneering static plasmonic colors achieved with invariant optical nanoantennas and ambient environment, then we address a variety of emerging approaches that enable dynamic color tuning, erasing, and restoring. These dynamic color filters are capable of actively changing the filtered colors and carrying more color information states than the static systems. Thus, they open an avenue to high-density data storage, information encryption, and plasmonic information processing. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future perspectives in this exciting research area.},

A collection of known textile fibers, 61 single-component textiles from 16 different types, were analyzed, resulting in more than 4000 individual spectra. The r-FT-IR method was compared with ATR-FT-IR spectroscopy using two instrumental approaches: FT-IR-microspectrometer with ATR mode (mATR-FT-IR) and ATR-FT-IR spectrometer (ATR-FT-IR). Advantages and drawbacks of these methods were discussed. Principal component based discriminant analysis and random forest classification methods were created for the identification of textile fibers in case-study samples. It was concluded that in general, the performance of r-FT-IR is comparable with ATR-FT-IR. In particular, r-FT-IR is more successful than ATR-FT-IR in differentiating between the amide-based fibers wool, silk and polyamide. As an additional result of this work, a collection of r-FT-IR spectra of different textile fibers was compiled and made available for the scientific community.},

abstract = {In the last three or four decades, studies of biomechanics have expanded from simple topical applications of elementary mechanics to entire areas of study. Studies and research in biomechanics now exceed those in basic mechanics itself, underlining the continuing and increasing importance of this area of study. With an emphasis on biodynamic modeling, Fundamentals of Biomechanics provides an accessible, basic understanding of the principles of biomechanics analyses. Following a brief introductory chapter, the book reviews gross human anatomy and basic terminology currently in use. It describes methods of analysis from elementary mathematics to elementary mechanics and goes on to fundamental concepts of the mechanics of materials. It then covers the modeling of biosystems and provides a brief overview of tissue biomechanics. The author then introduces the concepts of biodynamics and human body modeling, looking at the fundamentals of the kinematics, the kinetics, and the inertial properties of human body models. He supplies a more detailed analysis of kinematics, kinetics, and dynamics of these models and discusses the numerical procedures for solving the governing dynamical equations. The book concludes with a review of a few example applications of biodynamic models such as simple lifting, maneuvering in space, walking, swimming, and crash victim simulation. The inclusion of extensive lists of problems of varying difficulty, references, and an extensive bibliography add breadth and depth to the coverage. Focusing on biodynamic modeling to a degree not found in other texts, this book equips readers with the expertise in biomechanics they need for advanced studies, research, and employment in biomedical engineering.},

abstract = {In the last chapter, I discussed the ideas behind estimation, which is one of the two “big ideas” in inferential statistics. It's now time to turn out attention to the other big idea, which is hypothesis testing. In its most abstract form, hypothesis testing really a very simple idea: the researcher has some theory about the world, and wants to determine whether or not the data actually support that theory. However, the details are messy, and most people find the theory of hypothesis testing to be the most frustrating part of statistics. The structure of the chapter is as follows. Firstly, I'll describe how hypothesis testing works, in a fair amount of detail, using a simple running example to show you how a hypothesis test is “built”. I'll try to avoid being too dogmatic while doing so, and focus instead on the underlying logic of the testing procedure.158 Afterwards, I'll spend a bit of time talking about the various dogmas, rules and heresies that surround the theory of hypothesis testing.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {LEDs have been established as light sources in countless areas of optical sensing and chemical analysis, where they offer a better alternative to traditional light sources in terms of low-cost, small size and robustness supporting portability, and performance parameters such as low noise. However, the lack of rapid, facile and accurate radiometric analysis of LEDs is a major limiting factor which constrains their purposeful use. Therefore, here we present comprehensive radiometric analysis of LEDs in terms of absolute emission spectra, radiometric power output, irradiances, radiant efficiencies as well as uncertainties. This allowed us to develop and cross-validate a rapid, facile, accurate and low-cost radiometric analysis of LEDs with directional light output using a large active area silicon photodiode in a simple optical design with the LED light source in proximity, without the need for a calibrated light source. We demonstrate that data for a wide range of 21 commercial LEDs in UV, vis and NIR spectral range (255–950 nm) agree very well with two entirely independent approaches. First, we obtained an excellent agreement with accuracy within 5{\%} for radiometric power output measured using chemical actinometric methods. Further, we obtained irradiance (mW/cm2) and radiant efficiency values ({\%}) for the LEDs. The accuracy of irradiance measurement was within 2{\%} when compared with a spectrophotometric method based on a radiometrically calibrated spectrophotometer. The measurement uncertainty at 95{\%} confidence level for values of radiometric power output were reduced 3-fold compared to the existing techniques. We also demonstrate that this facile, accurate and low-cost radiometric analysis can be further extended to accurately measure quantum yield of photochemical reactions and fluence values in actinometric systems.},

abstract = {The introduction of two-photon polymerization (TPP) into the area of Carbon Micro Electromechanical Systems (C-MEMS) has enabled the fabrication of three-dimensional glassy carbon nanostructures with geometries previously unattainable through conventional UV lithography. Pyrolysis of TPP structures conveys a characteristic reduction of feature size—one that should be properly estimated in order to produce carbon microdevices with accuracy. In this work, we studied the volumetric shrinkage of TPP-derived microwires upon pyrolysis at 900 °C. Through this process, photoresist microwires thermally decompose and shrink by as much as 75{\%}, resulting in glassy carbon nanowires with linewidths between 300 and 550 nm. Even after the thermal decomposition induced by the pyrolysis step, the linewidth of the carbon nanowires was found to be dependent on the TPP exposure parameters. We have also found that the thermal stress induced during the pyrolysis step not only results in axial elongation of the nanowires, but also in buckling in the case of slender carbon nanowires (for aspect ratios greater than 30). Furthermore, we show that the calculated residual mass fraction that remains after pyrolysis depends on the characteristic dimensions of the photoresist microwires, a trend that is consistent with several works found in the literature. This phenomenon is explained through a semi-empirical model that estimates the feature size of the carbon structures, serving as a simple guideline for shrinkage evaluation in other designs.},

The manganese ferrite sol was obtained from manganese(II) nitrate and iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate molecular precursor based on a sol-gel procedure. Manganese ferrite (MnFe2O4) nanofibers were prepared by calcining the above composite fibers in air at 400, 600 and 800 °C, respectively. The obtained nanofibers were characterized by SEM, FT-IR, XRD, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). After being calcined at 800 °C, the fibers became continuous crystallites as a result of the complete decomposition of PVAc. The morphology of manganese ferrite was found to be cubic spinel structure containing eight oxygens and 12 metal atoms in the unit cell, referred from the results of EXAFS. Also, the magnetic properties of the calcined samples were characterized by using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this chapter we discuss how images are formed and captured, the first step in robot and human perception of the world. From images we can deduce the size, shape and position of objects in the world as well as other characteristics such as color and texture. It has long been known that a simple pin-hole is able to create a perfect inverted image on the wall of a darkened room. Some marine molluscs, for example the Nautilus, have pin-hole camera eyes. All vertebrates have a lens that forms an inverted image on the retina where the light-sensitive cells rod and cone cells, shown previously in Fig. 10.6, are arranged. A digital camera is similar in principle - a glass or plastic lens forms an image on the surface of a semiconductor chip with an array of light sensitive devices to convert light to a digital image. The process of image formation, in an eye or in a camera, involves a projection of the 3-dimensional world onto a 2-dimensional surface. The depth information is lost and we can no longer tell from the image whether it is of a large object in the distance or a smaller closer object. This transformation from 3 to 2 dimensions is known as perspective projection and is discussed in Sect. 11.1. Section 11.2 introduces the topic of camera calibration, the estimation of the parameters of the perspective transformation. In Sect. 11.2.3 we discuss the inverse problem, how to reconstruct 3-dimensional world points given a 2-dimensional image. Section 11.3 introduces alternative types of cameras capable of wide-angle or panoramic imaging.},

However, instead of being a general overview of the two topics, Fundamentals of Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering will identify and focus on specific areas in which attaining a solid competency is desired. This strategy is the direct result of studies showing that broad-based courses at the freshman level often leave students grappling with a lot of material, which results in a low rate of retention. Specifically, strong emphasis will be placed on the topic of material balances, with the intent that students exiting a course based upon this textbook will be significantly higher on Bloom's Taxonomy (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis and synthesis, evaluation, creation) relating to material balances. In addition, this book will also provide students with a highly developed ability to analyze problems from the material balances perspective, which will leave them with important skills for the future. The textbook will consist of numerous exercises and their solutions. Problems will be classified by their level of difficulty. Each chapter will have references and selected web pages to vividly illustrate each example. In addition, to engage students and increase their comprehension and rate of retention, many examples will involve real-world situations.},

Expansion of the model to a viscoelastic fluid, using the Giesekus constitutive equation was derived by Feng [3]. This report deals with expanding the Newtonian base code to a viscoelastic code. The main issue with the relaxation method is to provide the code with a sufficiently accurate initial guess. A method is presented that is based on a Newtonian solution as an initial guess for the vis-coelastic model. Solutions for a viscoelastic and a Newtonian fluid are compared and the effect of strain-hardening is shown.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyze current practices in commercial urban rooftop farming (URF). In recent years, URF has been experiencing increasing popularity. It is a practice that is well-suited to enhancing food security in cities and reducing the environmental impact that results from long transportation distances that are common in conventional agriculture. To date, most URF initiatives have been motivated by social and educational factors rather than the aim of creating large sustainable food production systems in cities. The commercial operation of urban rooftop farms, should they become profitable, is likely to attract notable private investment, allowing a significant level of high quality urban food production to be achieved. There is a reasonable amount of literature available on urban farming that deals with its potential, and its limitations. However, it does not focus on commercial operations. In contrast to other surveys and theoretical papers, this study of URF focuses on large and commercial operations. The analysis showed that commercial URFs can be grouped into two main types: Firstly, hydroponic systems in greenhouses where mostly leafy greens, tomatoes, and herbs are grown; secondly, soil-based open-air farms that grow a large variety of vegetables. Hydroponics is frequently seen as the key technology for commercial urban food production. While the technology is not in and of itself sustainable, hydroponic farms often make an effort to implement environmentally friendly technologies and methods. However, there is still untapped potential to systemically integrate farms into buildings. The findings of this study identified where future research is needed in order to make URF a widespread sustainable solution.},

abstract = {The disintegration of drops in strong electric fields is believed to play an important part in the formation of thunderstorms, at least in those parts of them where no ice crystals are present. Zeleny showed experimentally that disintegration begins as a hydrodynamical instability, but his ideas about the mechanics of the situation rest on the implicit assumption that instability occurs when the internal pressure is the same as that outside the drop. It is shown that this assumption is false and that instability of an elongated drop would not occur unless a pressure difference existed. When this error is corrected it is found that a drop, elongated by an electric field, becomes unstable when its length is 1.9 times its equatorial diameter, and the calculated critical electric field agrees with laboratory experiments to within 1 {\%}. When the drop becomes unstable the ends develop obtuse-angled conical points from which axial jets are projected but the stability calculations give no indication of the mechanics of this process. It is shown theoretically that a conical interface between two fluids can exist in equilibrium in an electric field, but only when the cone has a semi-vertical angle 49.3°. Apparatus was constructed for producing the necessary field, and photographs show that conical oil/water interfaces and soap films can be produced at the calculated voltage and that their semi-vertical angles are very close to 49.3°. The photographs give an indication of how the axial jets are produced but no complete analytical description of the process is attempted.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

@article{Rockstrom2009,
abstract = {Anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System have reached a scale where abrupt global environmental change can no longer be excluded. We propose a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere {\textless}350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m-2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80{\%} of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone ({\textless}5{\%} reduction in O3 concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N yr-1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use ({\textless}4000 km3 yr-1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change ({\textless}15{\%} of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of {\textless}10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social–ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of “planetary boundaries” lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the “planetary playing field” for humanity if we want to be sure of avoiding major human-induced environmental change on a global scale.},

@article{Taylor1969,
abstract = {[Plates 3 to 8] Fine jets of slightly conducting viscous fluids and thicker jets or drops of less viscous ones can be drawn from conducting tubes by electric forces. As the potential of the tube relative to a neighbouring plate rises, viscous fluids become nearly conical and fine jets come from the vertices. The potentials at which these jets or drops first appear was measured and compared with calculations. The stability of viscous jets depends on the geometry of the electrodes. Jets as small as 20 ,um in diameter and 5 cm long were produced which were quite steady up to a millimetre from their ends. Attempts to describe them mathematically failed. Their stability seems to be due to mechanical rather than electrical causes, like that of a stretched string, which is straight when pulled but bent when pushed. Experiments on the stability of water jets in a parallel electric field reveal two critical fields, one at which jets that are breaking into drops become steady and another at which these steady jets become unsteady again, without breaking into drops. Experiments are described in which a cylindrical soap film becomes unstable under a radial electric field. The results are compared with calculations by A. B. Basset and after a mistake in his analysis is corrected, agreement is found over the range where experiments are possible. Basset's calculations for axisymmetrical disturbances are extended to those in which the jet moves laterally. Though this is the form in which the instability appears, calculations about uniform jets do not seem to be relevant. In an appendix M. D. Van Dyke calculates the attraction between a long cylinder and a perpendicular plate at a different potential. It was pointed out 369 years ago by William Gilbert (i6oo) that a spherical drop of water on a dry surface is drawn up into a cone when a piece of rubbed amber is held at a suitable distance above it. This phenomenon has recently (Taylor I964) been subjected to theoretical treatment and it was shown that a conducting fluid can exist in equilibrium in the form of a cone under the action of an electric field but only when the semivertical angle is 49.3?. Apparatus was constructed in which the necessary field could be set up and very nearly conical fluid surfaces or inter-faces between two fluids were formed for which the semivertical angle was close to 49.3O. An uncharged drop in a uniform electric field is pulled out into a nearly spheroidal form which becomes unstable when the field reaches a maximum value 1.62 (T/ro)l (Taylor I964) and the drop has become 1.85 times as long as its equatorial diameter. Here the field was expressed in e.s. units and T the surface tension and ro, the initial radius, are expressed in c.g.s. units. The same analysis predicts possible equilibrium shapes which are longer than 1.85 times the diameter though the corresponding 29},

abstract = {To promote global food and ecosystem security, several innovative farming systems have been identified that better balance multiple sustainability goals. The most rapidly growing and contentious of these systems is organic agriculture. Whether organic agriculture can continue to expand will likely be determined by whether it is economically competitive with conventional agriculture. Here, we examined the financial performance of organic and conventional agriculture by conducting a meta-analysis of a global dataset spanning 55 crops grown on five continents. When organic premiums were not applied, benefit/cost ratios (−8 to −7{\%}) and net present values (−27 to −23{\%}) of organic agriculture were significantly lower than conventional agriculture. However, when actual premiums were applied, organic agriculture was significantly more profitable (22–35{\%}) and had higher benefit/cost ratios (20–24{\%}) than conventional agriculture. Although premiums were 29–32{\%}, breakeven premiums necessary for organic profits to match conventional profits were only 5–7{\%}, even with organic yields being 10–18{\%} lower. Total costs were not significantly different, but labor costs were significantly higher (7–13{\%}) with organic farming practices. Studies in our meta-analysis accounted for neither environmental costs (negative externalities) nor ecosystem services from good farming practices, which likely favor organic agriculture. With only 1{\%} of the global agricultural land in organic production, our findings suggest that organic agriculture can continue to expand even if premiums decline. Furthermore, with their multiple sustainability benefits, organic farming systems can contribute a larger share in feeding the world.},

abstract = {The electronic properties of graphene, such as high charge carrier concentrations and mobilities, make it a promising candidate for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. In particular, electrons and holes can undergo ballistic transport on the sub-micrometre scale in graphene and do not suffer from the scale limitations of current MOSFET technologies. However, it is still difficult to produce single-layer samples of graphene and bulk processing has not yet been achieved, despite strenuous efforts to develop a scalable production method. Here, we report a versatile solution-based process for the large-scale production of single-layer chemically converted graphene over the entire area of a silicon/SiO 2 wafer. By dispersing graphite oxide paper in pure hydrazine we were able to remove oxygen functionalities and restore the planar geometry of the single sheets. The chemically converted graphene sheets that were produced have the largest area reported to date (up to 20 × 40 $\mu$m), making them far easier to process. Field-effect devices have been fabricated by conventional photolithography, displaying currents that are three orders of magnitude higher than previously reported for chemically produced graphene. The size of these sheets enables a wide range of characterization techniques, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, to be performed on the same specimen. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Nanofibers have emerged as exciting one-dimensional nanomaterials for a broad spectrum of research and commercial applications owing to their unique physicochemical properties and characteristics. As a class of nanomaterials with cross-sectional diameters ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers, nanofibers possess extremely high specific surface area and surface area-to-volume ratio. They are capable of forming networks of highly porous mesh with remarkable interconnectivity between their pores, making them an attractive choice for a host of advanced applications. In fact, the significant impact of nanofiber technology can be traced from the wide range of fundamental materials that can be used for the synthesis of nanofibers. These include natural polymers, synthetic polymers, carbon-based materials, semiconducting materials, and composite materials. Correspondingly, the emerging proof-of-concept applications of nanofibers spanning several important areas have been rapidly reported. This Review explores the current status and up-and-coming development of nanofiber technology, with an emphasis on its syntheses and applications. First, we highlight the current and emerging strategies used in synthesizing nanofibers. We briefly introduce the various established nanofiber synthesis techniques, especially the electrospinning method. We then focus on the emerging nanofiber synthesis strategies, such as solution blow spinning, centrifugal jet spinning, and electrohydrodynamic direct writing. Next, we discuss the emerging applications of nanofiber technology in various fields, specifically in three important areas of energy generation and storage, water treatment and environmental remediation, and healthcare and biomedical engineering. Despite all these advancements, there are still challenges to be addressed and overcome for nanofiber technology to move towards maturation. Nevertheless, we envision that with further progress in the development of nanofiber synthesis strategies and identification of “killer” applications of nanofibers, nanofiber technology will mature and move beyond its current state towards commercial realization and applications.},

abstract = {Studies have pointed at the negative side of urban green spaces in terms of evoking fear of crime. However research on fear-provoking attributes suggests that there usually is no single attribute that influences fear but that rather a combination of attributes prevails. The aim of the paper is to systematically review those attributes that evoke fear of crime in urban green spaces and to highlight their complex interaction by adopting a social-ecological framework. Results include an overview of the reviewed literature with regard to authorship, journal, geographical distribution of the studies, types of urban green spaces studies, types of landscape stimulus used, applied methods, types of respondents involved and main study findings. Forty-eight studies met the authors' inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies highlighted that individual factors (such as gender and past experience) were more influential than social and physical factors in evoking fear of crime. A proposed socio-ecological framework highlights the attributes which evoke fear of crime in urban green spaces and its interactions and can help guide future research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

It addresses various topics, such as chairing discussions, poster management, discussion sessions, the TED phenomenon, workshops, and the emerging field of English as a lingua franca. The style alternates between the accessible and practical, and the analysis of the linguistic categories underpinning the discuourse: genre analysis, the nature of the specialist discourse community, features of academic spoken discourse, and the presentations as multimodal narrative are all explored.

abstract = {This study reports the development of a novel hydrogen gas sensor based on an array of single suspended carbon nanowires (diameter ∼200 nm, length ∼100 $\mu$m) decorated with Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) of various sizes for room temperature H2 gas sensing. These sensors provide high sensitivity, a wide sensing range (10 ppm – 5{\%}), and complete gas response recovery in 5 s with ultralow power consumption (30 $\mu$W). Such performance is achieved using a novel suspended PdNP/carbon nanowire architecture, which offers enhanced mass transfer, high surface area to volume ratios, and good thermal insulation. This platform can be fabricated using simple batch microfabrication processes including carbon-MEMS and electrodeposition. The sensitivity and range of the sensor can be modulated by controlling Pd nanoparticle sizes (3–5 nm PdNPs: 3.2{\%} ppm−1/2, 10–1000 ppm; 10–15 nm PdNPs: 0.32{\%} ppm−1/2, 700 ppm – 5{\%}). A wide sensing range is achieved by integrating nanowires with various sizes of PdNPs onto a chip. The electrical resistance of a suspended PdNP/carbon nanowire quickly and completely recovers its original state in a very short time via ultralow-power, Joule heat-based self-heating. This enables reproducible and long-term durable gas sensing.},

The bubble characteristics can be controlled through simple adjustments to the processing parameters. Bubbles with diameters in the range of 240–1000 $\mu$m were fabricated in controlled fashion. FT-IR characterization confirmed that the rate of air infused during processing enhanced $\beta$-sheet packing in SF at higher flow rates.

The present study investigates release characteristics of diclofenac sodium encapsulated at three concentrations (5, 10, and 20{\%} w/v) in poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co -3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) nanofibers made by electrospinning and SBS and determines the drug's effect on fiber morphology and structural properties. PHBV nanofibers were characterized using scanning electronic microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction, and the release profile was examined via UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Both electrospinning and SBS encapsulated diclofenac sodium in PHBV membranes efficiently and effectively. The profile of the in vitro release of diclofenac sodium was dependent on drug concentration and temperature. The drug reduced crystallinity and increased flexibility. },

@techreport{Pramanick2018a,
abstract = {Pyrolysis is the process to thermally decompose an organic material into its carbon backbone in an oxygen-free environment. This process is used in the Carbon-MEMS fabrication technology to carbonize micro-structures patterned on a substrate. The properties of the resulting carbon material are dependent on either the carbon precursor or the pyrolysis conditions. In this work, SU-8 photoresist was used as the carbon precursor to study the effects of three pyrolysis parameters: 1) maximum pyrolysis temperature (600°C, 700°C, 800°C, and 900°C), 2) temperature ramp rate (2.5°C/min, 5°C/min, 10°C/min, and 20°C/min), and 3) nitrogen flow rate (3l/min, 4.5l/min, 6l/min, and 7.5l/min). To studythe effect of the maximum temperature, the temperature ramp rate and nitrogen flow rate were kept constant to 5°C/min and 6l/min respectively. For the temperature ramp rate experiments, we kept the maximum pyrolysis temperature and nitrogen flow rate constant to 900°C and 6l/min respectively. For the nitrogen flow rate study, the maximum pyrolysis temperature and temperature ramp rate were kept constant to 900°C and 5°C/min respectively. We found that no polymer structures persisted under the following conditions: 900°C maximum pyrolysis temperature, 5°C/min temperature ramp rate, and 3l/min nitrogen flow rate. Under these conditions the nitrogen flow rate is not high enough to keep the furnace environment (approximate volume of the furnace tube we used is 6l) entirely inert; in the pyrolysis process, even a small amount of oxygen destroys the intended C-MEMS. All the carbon samples were characterized using 4-point probe measurement for electrical resistivity; confocal microscopy for pore size determination; Raman spectroscopy, electron diffraction x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for chemical characterization. Furthermore, the samples were electrochemically characterized using cyclic voltammetry in a 1mM K 4 Fe(CN) 6 and 0.5M KCl solution. The characterization results suggest that samples prepared under the following conditions-900°C maximum pyrolysis temperature, 5°C/min temperature ramp rate, and 6l/min nitrogen flow rate, exhibit the best electrical, physical, chemical and electrochemical properties among the other conditions used.},

Controlled synthesis of well-defined PAN by reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) techniques is discussed as a route to tailored carbon precursors of various architectures, such as block copolymers (BCPs) and organic-inorganic hybrids. Primary examples of different approaches to templating include the use of PAN-containing BCPs self-assembled on planar surfaces or in solution to yield: (i) bulk carbon films, (ii) discrete nano-objects and (iii) mesoporous copolymer-templated nanocarbons (CTNCs).

Special attention is devoted to nitrogen doping in PAN-derived partially graphitic carbons and to the evaluation of nitrogen-enriched nanocarbons in energy conversion and storage applications such as supercapacitors, lithium-sulfur batteries, electrocatalysts, solar cells or CO 2 sorbents.},

abstract = {Since pioneer works by Iijima in 1991, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have received a great deal of attention as confirmed by the increasing number of papers in the topic their unique and attractive properties have made them extensively demanded materials for a wide variety of technological applications, including their promising use as scaffolds in tissue engineering. In this review, we focus on the role that polymers (both natural and synthetic) play on the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) CNT-based scaffolds for biomedical applications, with emphasis on biocompatible fabrication strategies such as freeze-casting, electrospinning and gel formation these 3D matrices may be an interesting and alternative platform to circumvent structural limitations and toxicity problems of bare CNTs by the use of biocompatible dispersant polymers that allow the preparation of substrates better resembling native extracellular matrices. In any case, due to the relevance of CNT toxicity in this context, we also discuss significant works concerning cell and tissue responses to CNTs in dispersion, highlighting: (1) the asbestos-like behavior of CNTs, (2) surface functionalization as a tool to reduce CNT toxicity and (3) CNT biodistribution from the blood stream and posterior excretion. In this sense, literature revision has evidenced major toxicity issues related to: (a) the inherent insolubility and tendency to aggregate of pristine CNTs, (b) the rigidity of their structures that makes them resemble asbestos, (c) the presence of residual metal impurities or amorphous carbon from their synthesis, and (d) the depletion of culture media components due to the adsorptive properties of CNTs. Nevertheless, as expected for almost any material, we also illustrate how dose plays a key role in the biological responses induced. Overall, this critic review is expected to help research community working on polymers and CNTs, as well as other carbon nanomaterials such as graphene, to identify useful guidelines that help advancing the use of 3D CNT-based scaffolds in biomedical applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@book{Dean2017,
abstract = {Since writing the first edition of Design and Analysis of Experiments, there have been a number of additions to the research investigator's toolbox. In this second edition, we have incorporated a few of these modern topics. Small screening designs are now becoming prevalent in industry for aiding the search for a few influential factors from amongst a large pool of factors of potential interest. In Chap. 15, we have expanded the material on saturated designs and introduced the topic of supersaturated designs which have fewer observations than the number of factors being investigated. We have illustrated that useful information can be gleaned about influential factors through the use of supersaturated designs even though their contrast estimators are correlated. When curvature is of interest, we have described definitive screening designs which have only recently been introduced in the literature, and which allow second order effects to be measured while retaining independence of linear main effects and requiring barely more than twice as many observations as factors. Another modern set of tools, now used widely in areas such as biomedical and materials engineering, the physical sciences, and the life sciences, is that of computer experiments. To give a flavor of this topic, a new Chap. 20 has been added. Computer experiments are typically used when a mathematical description of a physical process is available, but a physical experiment cannot be run for ethical or cost reasons. We have discussed the major issues in both the design and analysis of computer experiments. While the complete treatment of the theoretical background for the analysis is beyond the scope of this book, we have provided enough technical details of the statistical model, as well as an intuitive explanation, to make the analysis accessible to the intended reader. We have also provided computer code needed for both design and analysis. Chapter 19 has been expanded to include two new experiments involving split-plot designs from the discipline of human factors engineering. In one case, imbalance due to lost data, coupled with a mixed model, motivates introduction of restricted-maximum-likelihood-based methods implemented in the computer software sections, including a comparison of these methods to those based on least squares estimation. It is now the case that analysis of variance and computation of confidence intervals is almost exclusively done by computer and rarely by hand. However, we have retained the basic material on these topics since it is fundamental to the understanding of computer output. We have removed some of the more specialized details of least squares estimates from Chaps. 10–12 and canonical analysis details in Chap. 16, relying on the computer software sections to illustrate these. SAS{\textregistered} software is still used widely in industry, but many university departments now teach the analysis of data using R (R Development Core Team, 2017). This is a command line software for statistical computing and graphics that is freely available on the web. Consequently, we have made a major addition to the book by including sections illustrating the use of R software for each chapter. These sections run parallel to the “Using SAS Software” sections, retained from the first edition. A few additions have been made to the “Using SAS Software” sections. For example, in Chap. 11, PROC OPTEX has been included for generation of efficient block designs. PROC MIXED is utilized in Chap. 5 to implement Satterthwaite's method, and also in Chaps. 17–19 to estimate standard errors involving composite variance estimates, and in Chap. 19 to implement restricted maximum likelihood estimation given imbalanced data and mixed models. We have updated the SAS output1 , showing this as reproductions of PC output windows generated by each program. The SAS programs presented can be run on a PC or in a command line environment such as unix, although the latter would use PROC PLOT rather than the graphics PROC SGPLOT. Some minor modifications have been made to a few other chapters from the first edition. For example, for assessing which contrasts are non-negligible in single replicate or fractional factorial experiments, we have replaced normal probability plots by half-normal probability plots (Chaps. 7, 13 and 15). The reason for this change is that contrast signs are dependent upon which level of the factor is labeled as the high level and which is labeled as the low level. Half-normal plots remove this potential arbitrariness by plotting the absolute values of the contrast estimates against “half-normal scores”. Section 7.6 in the first edition on the control of noise variability and Taguchi experiments has been removed, while the corresponding material in Chap. 15 has been expanded. On teaching the material, we found it preferable to have information on mixed arrays, product arrays, and their analysis, in one location. The selection of multiple comparison methods in Chap. 4 has been shortened to include only those methods that were used constantly throughout the book. Thus, we removed the method of multiple comparisons with the best, which was not illustrated often; however, this method remains appropriate and valid for many situations in practice. Some of the worked examples in Chap. 10 have been replaced with newer experiments, and new worked examples added to Chaps. 15 and 19. Some new exercises have been added to many chapters. These either replace exercises from the first edition or have been added at the end of the exercise list. All other first edition exercises retain their same numbers in this second edition. A new website http://www.wright.edu/*dan.voss/ DeanVossDraguljic.html has been set up for the second edition. This contains material similar to that on the website for the first edition, including datasets for examples and exercises, SAS and R programs, and any corrections. We continue to owe a debt of gratitude to many. We extend our thanks to all the many students at The Ohio State University and Wright State University who provided imaginative and interesting experiments and gave us permission to include their projects. We thank all the readers who notified us of errors in the first edition and we hope that we have remembered to include all the corrections. We will be equally grateful to readers of the second edition for notifying us of any newly introduced errors. We are indebted to Russell Lenth for updating the R package lsmeans to encompass all the multiple comparisons procedures used in this book. We are grateful to the editorial staff at Springer, especially Rebekah McClure and Hannah Bracken, who were always available to give advice and answer our questions quickly and in detail.

abstract = {The need to largely reduce the amount of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions in the coming years all over the world requires a large effort in decarbonising the economy. One of the sectors most in need of this effort is the transportation sector. In fact, only a large reduction of CO2 emissions in this sector will allow coping effectively with this problem. There are two ways to perform it (1) by increasing the amount of biofuels to be used by Internal Combustion Motors or (2) by making a shift towards electromobility. However, this shift towards the electrification of the transportation sector can only be well succeeded if one increases simultaneously the proportion of non-CO2-emitting power generation technologies, namely renewable based power sources. European Union (EU) is developing a large effort on these matters. In fact, the energy-related targets set by EU policy require careful exami- nation of potential solutions for the integration of renewable energy sources to meet the electricity demand. On the other side, the expected growing energy demand resulting from the introduction of electric-powered cars needs the development of innovative concepts to exploit the variable power supply. The application of dynamic techniques for prediction of electricity supply and demand, including electricity prices in the market, is expected to support the optimisation of the grid balance. The European wind markets predict an installed capacity that would provide 14 {\%} of the electricity consumption in 2020. Today in Denmark and Portugal, the wind power accounts for more than 20 {\%} of the power production.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Entering the information age, scientists are discovering new applications and manipulating chemical composition of materials in nanometer scale. In such a tiny scale, surface electrons play a big role. Outmost electrons shielding an atom or a molecular represent the characteristics of the atom or the molecular. The characteristics include the electrical, chemical, and optical properties of the material. The characteristics also effect how the nano-material can be processed. On the surface of a gold nanoparticle composited by a minimum of eleven or more gold atoms, the negative electronic shielding the particle provide a Coulomb force to bind with the thiol-end copolymers or the bases of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Then, the combination can be self-assembled by the electrical attraction on the addition materials. Gold nanoparticles have wide applications such as optical, magnetic, and medical applications. By understand its synthesis process of formation and binding mechanism to other additional materials, engineers will be able to develop more stable and useful products out of gold nanoparticles.},

abstract = {Compared with traditional conductive fillers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have unique advantages, i.e., excellent mechanical properties, high electrical conductivity and thermal stability. Nanocomposites as piezoresistive films provide an interesting approach for the realization of large area strain sensors with high sensitivity and low manufacturing costs. A polymer-based nanocomposite with carbon nanomaterials as conductive filler can be deposited on a flexible substrate of choice and this leads to mechanically flexible layers. Such sensors allow the strain measurement for both integral measurement on a certain surface and local measurement at a certain position depending on the sensor geometry. Strain sensors based on carbon nanostructures can overcome several limitations of conventional strain sensors, e.g., sensitivity, adjustable measurement range and integral measurement on big surfaces. The novel technology allows realizing strain sensors which can be easily integrated even as buried layers in material systems. In this review paper, we discuss the dependence of strain sensitivity on different experimental parameters such as composition of the carbon nanomaterial/polymer layer, type of polymer, fabrication process and processing parameters. The insights about the relationship between film parameters and electromechanical properties can be used to improve the design and fabrication of CNT strain sensors. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {The aim of the work presented here was to develop curing polymers for nanoimprint lithography (NIL) enabling short cycle time, low imprint temperature, and an isothermal imprint process. The result is mr-NIL 6000LT: A photochemically curing polymer system for isothermal imprinting by combined thermal and UV nanoimprint lithography. It allows a lower imprint temperature than materials presented previously [C. Schuster, M. Kubenz, F. Reuther, M. Fink, G. Gr{\"{u}}tzner, mr-NIL 6000 - New epoxy-based curing resist for efficient processing in combined thermal and UV nanoimprint lithography, in: Proceedings of SPIE 6517 2007, 65172B.; D.W. Johnson, H. Miller, M. Kubenz, F. Reuther, G. Gr{\"{u}}tzner, Nanoimprinting with SU-8 Epoxy Resists, in: Proceedings of SPIE 6517 2007, 65172A.]. The material system chosen is based on a blend of epoxy resins and a photo acid generator. Such epoxy resists cure during the imprint step in combined thermal and UV nanoimprint lithography. Initiated by UV exposure the cationic polymerisation occurs at elevated temperature forming a polymer pattern with significantly increased thermal stability compared to the uncured system. Apart from the material development leading to mr-NIL 6000LT the correlations between the parameters imprint temperature, exposure time and post exposure hold time are investigated in this work. With the applied resin combination a Tg of -15 °C is obtained. This enables the formation of solid films at room temperature after spin-coating and prebake and nevertheless imprint temperatures in the range of 45-50 °C, which is a distinct decrease compared to the 100-110 °C needed for the previously introduced mr-NIL 6000 [C. Schuster, M. Kubenz, F. Reuther, M. Fink, G.

Gr{\"{u}}tzner, Nanoimprinting with SU-8 Epoxy Resists, in: Proceedings of SPIE 6517 2007, 65172A.]. mr-NIL 6000LT exhibits good dimensional stability at 120 °C after curing during the imprint process.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Intrinsically conducting polymers have been studied extensively due to their intriguing electronic and redox properties and numerous potential applications in many fields since their discovery in 1970s. To improve and extend their functions, the fabrication of multi-functionalized conducting polymer nanocomposites has attracted a great deal of attention because of the emergence of nanotechnology. This article presents an overview of the synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) conducting polymer nanocomposites and their properties and applications. Nanocomposites consist of conducting polymers and one or more components, which can be carbon nanotubes, metals, oxide nanomaterials, chalcogenides, insulating or conducting polymers, biological materials, metal phthalocyanines and porphyrins, etc. The properties of 1D conducting polymer nanocomposites will be widely discussed. Special attention is paid to the difference in the properties between 1D conducting polymer nanocomposites and bulk conducting polymers. Applications of 1D conducting polymer nanocomposites described include electronic nanodevices, chemical and biological sensors, catalysis and electrocatalysis, energy, microwave absorption and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, electrorheological (ER) fluids, and biomedicine. The advantages of 1D conducting polymer nanocomposites over the parent conducting polymers are highlighted. Combined with the intrinsic properties and synergistic effect of each component, it is anticipated that 1D conducting polymer nanocomposites will play an important role in various fields of nanotechnology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

An attempt has been made to anticipate the conceptual problems students encounter when they first study quantum mechanics. Wherever possible, examples are given to illustrate the underlying physics associated with the mathematical equations of quantum mechanics. To this end, connections are made with corresponding phenomena in classical mechanics and electromagnetism. The problems at the end of each chapter are intended to help students master the course material and to explore more advanced topics. Many calculations exploit the extraordinary capabilities of computer programs such as Mathematica, MatLab, and Maple. Students are urged to use these programs, just as they had been urged to use calculators in the past. The treatment of various topics is rather complete, in that most steps in derivations are included. Several of the chapters go beyond what is traditionally covered in an introductory course. The goal of the presentation is to provide the students with a solid background in quantum mechanics.{\#}xE000.

After their end-user applications, these NPs find their way into the environment and food products. The NPs so discharged need to be quantified accurately to determine their toxicity and exposure levels. At this time, there is a need to develop a unified method for their determination. There are plenty of techniques available in the market that were initially used for colloidal particles (e.g., microscopy, spectroscopy and the recent addition of magnetic resonance), but each of these techniques has a certain degree of uncertainty. Further, sample homogeneity, sample preparation, instrument-operating procedures, and statistical practices are likely to add to the complexity of the problem.

abstract = {Ghana is a typical low-income sub-Saharan African country facing significant sanitation challenges. In Ghana, fresh salads are not part of the normal diet, but have become a common supplement to urban fast food served in streets, canteens and restaurants. In Accra, about 200 000 people consume from such supplements every day. The figure also describes the size of the risk group from contamination, which comprises all income classes including the poor and children. The purpose of this study was to investigate widespread water pollution in urban and peri-urban areas, where 95{\%} of the lettuce consumed in the city is produced. Over 12 months (April 2004-June 2005), lettuce samples from the same production sites in two cities were followed and analyzed along the "farm to fork" pathway for total and faecal coliform (FC) and helminth egg numbers. Questionnaire surveys were conducted among producers, sellers and consumers to quantify lettuce flows to the final risk group. The study identified the farm as the main point of lettuce contamination. Besides the irrigation water, contamination was also attributed to manure application and already contaminated soil. Despite poor sanitary conditions in markets, post-harvest handling and marketing did not further increase the farm-gate contamination levels. To reduce the health risk associated with the consumption of contaminated lettuce; safer farming and irrigation practices are required while the remaining risk could best be addressed where lettuce is prepared for consumption.},

abstract = {In this paper, the authors examined the role of market women in the informal urban economy and the factors that threaten the effective performance of their roles. Interviewing 360 foodstuff sellers from the Kumasi Central Market and the Race Course Markets, the authors identified that the market women had made significant contributions towards Ghana{\&}{\#}8217;s fiscal decentralisation through the payment of levies and rents. They have also created jobs, provided incomes for households, ensured food security and sufficiency, and provided a platform for generational development of entrepreneurial skills and competence. However, their roles in the informal economy were constrained by the inadequate basic infrastructure in the markets, limited access to credit facilities and transportation difficulties. The paper therefore recommended the provision of basic life enhancing infrastructure and credit facilities complemented with capacity building in business management.},

@article{Brown2016,
abstract = {Over the last decade, melt electrospinning has emerged as an alternative polymer processing technology to alleviate concerns associated with solvents in traditional electrospinning. This has resulted in the fabrication of ultrafine fibers from an increasing range of synthetic polymers and composite systems, to materials including ceramics, driving new applications in technical areas such as textiles, filtration, environment and energy as well as biomedicine. In this article, we review the significant advancements in theoretical modeling of the underlying physical principles, coupled with experimental validation using a variety of technical devices and designs that allows well-controlled fiber formation using optimized material and operating parameters. Innovative device designs are indicating avenues towards higher throughput of randomly collected melt electrospun fibers for the production of commodity nonwoven substrates, similar to solution electrospinning and many other industrial fiber-forming processes. However, we identify a recent shift in perception towards melt electrospinning in the literature, where the adaptation of additive manufacturing approaches to device designs enables precise fiber placement with filament resolutions not yet demonstrated by more established melt-extrusion based direct writing technologies. New, highly ordered arrangements of ultrafine fibers with distinctive surface topology, encapsulating and sensing properties are opening new fields of application in areas such as drug delivery, biosensors and regenerative medicine as high performance materials. The development of these materials is reviewed with an emphasis on an area of current research, where melt electrospun scaffolds are contributing to promising treatment strategies to regenerate or replace human tissue and for the new field of in vitro disease models as well as humanized mice models.},

@book{DeGraaf2016,
abstract = {This textbook is the second volume in the Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modeling series and aims to explain the theoretical basis of magnetic interactions at a level that will be useful for master students in physical, inorganic and organic chemistry. The book gives a treatment of magnetic interactions in terms of the phenomenological spin Hamiltonians that have been such powerful tools for chemistry and physics in the past half century, starting from the simple Heisenberg and Ising Hamiltonians and ending with Hamiltonians that include biquadratic, cyclic or anisotropic exchange. On the other hand, it also explains how quantum chemical methods, reaching from simple mean field methods to accurate models that include the effects of electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling, can help to understand the magnetic properties. Connecting the two perspectives is an essential aspect of the book, since it leads to a deeper understanding of the relation between physical phenomena and basic properties. It also makes clear that in many cases one can derive magnetic coupling parameters not only from experiment, but also from accurate ab initio calculations. The book starts with introducing a selection of basic concepts and tools. Throughout the book the text is interlarded with exercises, stimulating the students to not only read but also verify the assertions and perform (parts of) the derivations by themselves. In addition, each chapter ends with a number of problems that can be used to check whether the material has been understood.},

abstract = {If reasonably uniformly sized spherical pellets are packed in a tube only slightly larger in size, so that the tube/pellet dia ratio is from 1??1 to 1??4, and the tube contains 50 or more pellets, then the flow behaviour is very similar to that of a conventional packed bed. Pressure drop results and axial dispersion values obtained for non-porous pellets using pulse techniques can be predicted from existing packed bed correlations. Magnetite pellets of different porosities were used as porous packing, also, and, by Fourier analysis of outlet tracer pulse dispersion, external mass transfer and effective diffusion coefficients were obtained, assuming the validity of the Kubin-Kucera model. The use of this 'single pellet string reactor' (SPSR) appears to give a convenient laboratory simulation of a packed bed reactor, which would be particularly useful for larger solid particles such as pelletized ores. It also offers a convenient laboratory method for obtaining average effective diffusion coefficients over a range of temperatures and pressures for a representative sample of large porous particles. ?? 1974.},

Compared with traditional emulsion fabrication techniques, electrospraying has the potential to reduce denaturation of protein drugs and affords tighter regulation over particle size distribution and morphology. In this article, we review the importance of the electrospraying parameters that enable reproducible tailoring of the particles' physical and in vitro drug release characteristics, along with discussion of existing in vivo data. Controlled morphology and monodispersity of particles can be achieved with electrospraying, with high encapsulation efficiencies and without unfavorable denaturation of bioactive molecules throughout the process. Finally, the combination of electrospraying with electrospun scaffolds, with an emphasis on tissue regeneration is reviewed, depicting a technique in its relative infancy but holding great promise for the future of regenerative medicine. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is a quantitative analytical technique that monitors the mass of a sample from 1 mg to several g as a furnace ramps temperature to as high as 1600°C under a stable or changing gas flow. The first gravimetric test was in 27 BC when Vitruvius measured limestone's change of mass as it calcined to lime. In modern chemical engineering, researchers apply the technique to derive conversions, kinetics, and mechanisms for any process with a change of mass by isothermal, non-isothermal, and quasi-isothermal methods. The mass drops as the sample decomposes, volatile compounds evaporate, or the oxidation state decreases, while in reactive environments (with O2, for example), the mass of transition metals may increase. TGA is incapable of detecting phase transitions, polymorphic transformations, or reactions for which mass is invariant. DSC or DTA couple with TGA to help deconvolute a DSC plot by separating physical changes from chemical changes. Evolved gas analysis techniques monitor the gaseous products exiting the TGA furnace on-line as the temperature ramps. A bibliometric map of keywords from articles citing TGA indexed by Web of Science in 2016 and 2017 identified five research clusters: nanoparticles, performance, and films; crystal structures, acid, and oxidation; composites, nanocomposites, and mechanical properties; kinetics, pyrolysis, and temperature; and adsorption, water and wastewater, and aqueous solutions. This review provides an overview of the basic principles of modern TGA.},

abstract = {Light-assisted 3D direct-printing of biomaterials and cellular-scaffolds has the potential to develop novel lab-on-a-chip devices (LOCs) for a variety of biomedical applications, from drug discovery and diagnostic testing to in vitro tissue engineering and regeneration. Direct-writing describes a broad family of fabrication methods that typically employ computer-controlled translational stages to manufacture structures at multi-length scales. This review focuses on light-assisted direct-write fabrication for generating 3D functional scaffolds with precise micro- and nano-architecture, using both synthetic as well as naturally derived biomaterials. Two bioprinting approaches are discussed in detail - projection printing and laser-based systems - where each method is capable of modulating multiple scaffold parameters, such as 3D architecture, mechanical properties (e.g. stiffness), Poisson's ratio, chemical gradients, biological cell distributions, and porosity. The light-assisted direct-writing techniques described in this review provide the reader with alternative approaches to fabricate 3D biomaterials for utility in LOCs.},

I synthesized published studies in order to estimate a global mean extinction rate and determine which factors contribute the greatest uncertainty to climate change-induced extinction risks. Results suggest that extinction risks will accelerate with future global temperatures, threatening up to one in six species under current policies. Extinction risks were highest in South America, Australia, and New Zealand, and risks did not vary by taxonomic group. Realistic assumptions about extinction debt and dispersal capacity substantially increased extinction risks. We urgently need to adopt strategies that limit further climate change if we are to avoid an acceleration of global extinctions.},

abstract = {Preface Landscape ecology continues to grow as an exciting, dynamic ecological discipline. With its broadscale emphasis and multidisciplinary approach, landscape ecology lends itself both to basic research and to applications in land management, land-use planning, wildlife management, ecosystem management, and conservation biology. Landscape ecology makes a unique contribution to the scientific community in its attention to ecological dynamics across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, and as a result it has become increasingly important for students in the natural sciences to gain a basic understanding of the subject. Colleges and universities across the United States are incorporating courses in landscape ecology into their curricula. However, nearly every book on landscape ecology is a book to be read, lacking a hands-on approach. This text is intended to fill that void by providing a comprehensive collection of landscape ecology laboratory exercises. These teaching exercises stress the fundamental concepts of landscape ecology, rather than highly specialized, technical methods. While students will gain experience using a variety of tools commonly used in landscape ecology, we stress the conceptual understanding necessary to use these techniques appropriately. This book attempts to convey the myriad approaches used by landscape ecologists (as well as a multitude of approaches to teaching) and include group discussion, thought problems, fieldwork, data analysis, spatial data collection, exposure to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), simulation modeling, analysis of landscape metrics, spatial statistics, and written exercises. This book is divided into seven sections, which complement the companion textbook, Landscape Ecology in Theory and Practice: Pattern and Process, by M. G. Turner, R. H. Gardner, and R. V. O{\^{a}}texttrademarkNeill. However, this textbook is also a useful stand-alone volume that can be used for teaching and learning. We also hope practicing landscape ecologists will find this book to be a useful reference.},

abstract = {Recent advances in fabricating 3D micro- and nanostructures using carbon microelectromechanical systems, or C-MEMS, has opened up a wide variety of new and exciting applications. The development of 3D C-MEMS has been catapulted forward by the use of transparent, high-viscosity resists such as SU-8. The electrical characteristics and shrinkage of various thickness carbon films derived from SU-8 and AZ P4620 are quantified and discussed in the context of the decomposition and carbonization mechanisms of epoxy and phenolic resins. Measurements obtained reveal a thickness dependence of the resistivity at lower carbonization temperatures but not much dependence at 1000°C. Possible explanations for this low-temperature thickness dependence are given. The electrical characteristics of carbon films obtained from both types of photoresists carbonized at 1000°C are very similar to that of glassy carbon. Simulations have been carried out to demonstrate the importance of the carbon resistivity for C-MEMS devices when used in conductive media. A method for simple optimization and verification of C-MEMS device designs for use in conductive media is introduced.},

This chapter discusses the logic and methods of meta-analysis with specific application to the field of criminology and criminal justice. A key feature of meta-analysis is the effect size, which encodes the study findings on a common index, such as the standardized mean difference, correlation coefficient, or odds-ratio. Analysis of these effect sizes considers not only the central tendency of effects across studies but also the relationship of study features to variability in effects. Both fixed- and random-effects models are discussed, as are the important issue of publication selection bias. Meta-analysis applies social science methodology and statistical methods to the task of taking stock of the evidence in an area, providing a robust foundation for future research and theorizing.},

abstract = {Child labour is one of the faces of poverty and is a great concern in many developing countries Nigeria inclusive. There is a paucity of information on child labour among the rural poor in Southern Nigeria. This study attempts to fill this lacuna by examining some issues and facts on child labour. This paper reviews the supply factors that influence the use of child labour in agriculture and some of the policy implications. Among the important factors that push children into the work force highlighted in this paper are family poverty, larger household size, lack of accessible and quality education, culture or family traditions and HIV/AIDS pandemic. The major factor influencing the supply of child labour in agriculture is poverty. Families with larger number of children are more susceptible to give their children to work in order to augment family income. Although there is free and compulsory education policy in most countries including Nigeria, and the enrolment rate in public schools has increased. The cost of a child's education is not equal to zero for the poorest of poor rural households when there is free education. Parents are unable to send their children to school when direct costs of uniform, transportation to and from school, books, and writing materials need to be supplied from meagre to household income. Children's social and cultural background also play an important role in their participation in work and educational opportunities. This study underscores the need for government at all levels and development stakeholders to mainstream child labour considerations in relevant development and management policies, strategies, programmes and plans and to effectively tackle child labour, and create a pathway for the elimination of child labour.},

abstract = {The purpose of Grammar for Teachers is to encourage readers to develop a solid understanding of the use and function of grammatical structures in American English. It approaches grammar from a descriptive rather than a prescriptive approach; however, throughout Grammar for Teachers differences between formal and informal language, and spoken and written English are discussed. Grammar for Teachers avoids jargon or excessive use of technical terminology and reviews essential grammar structures clearly and concisely. The text encourages users to tap into their own, often subconscious, knowledge of the grammar of English and to make it a conscious knowledge they can apply to their own varied teaching settings. Grammar for Teachers emphasizes looking at grammar from the perspective of learners of English, an approach that allows teachers to better appreciate the language difficulties learners of English face in ESL or mainstream classrooms. Discussions of areas of difficulties for learners of English are included throughout the text. Grammar for Teachers makes the study of grammar interesting and relevant by presenting grammar in context and by using authentic material from a wide variety of sources, including magazines, newspapers, children's books, bestsellers, works of literature, and academic prose. In each chapter, the numerous Discovery Activities engage users in exploring the different elements of grammar and in considering how these elements work together to form meaningful units. The subsequent discussion of each Discovery Activity allows users to explore specific elements of grammar on their own. At the end of each chapter, additional Practice Activities ask users to apply the grammar concepts presented in each chapter. Included in the Practice Activities are samples of relevant learner errors and error analysis exercises. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. All rights reserved.},

Resilience, as a framework for understanding and approaching community development, emerged more gradually out of ecological studies in the 1980s, but has only recently, since the mid-2000s, emerged as a focus of public interest as a way of responding and adapting to the planet's growing anthropogenic changes. For many, sustainability and resilience are slightly nuanced perspectives on the same phenomenon. For others, however, there are distinct differences between them, with sustainability's conservation goals being in opposition to the adaptation goals of resilience. Two major reasons for these confusions are (1) both concepts are defined and used in many different ways to achieve a variety of political goals that may not reflect their core definitions, and (2) bot...},

abstract = {According to social identity theory, people derive part of their identity – their social identity – from the groups to which they belong (e.g., an identity as “student,” “woman,” “left-hander,” or “Barcelona supporter”). Social identities differ in strength and content. The strength component is conceptualized in terms of social identification (e.g., “I identity strongly with Europeans”), while the content of social identity is determined by the group's features (e.g., colors associated with a soccer team) and norms (e.g., “real men don't cry”). Social identity determines emotions (e.g., depression after a team loss) and behavior (e.g., discrimination against out-groups or effort on behalf of one's in-group). In this chapter we outline the basic features of social identity theory – from social categorization to coping with a negative social identity – and then discuss two important domains of application: health and organizations. We conclude by describing a social identity-based intervention for improving intergroup relations in an educational setting.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group. The bioavailability of the anthelminthic flubendazole was remarkably enhanced in comparison with the pure crystalline drug by developing completely amorphous electrospun nanofibres with a matrix consisting of hydroxypropyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin and polyvinylpyrrolidone. The thus produced formulations can potentially be active against macrofilariae parasites causing tropical diseases, for example, river blindness and elephantiasis, which affect altogether more than a hundred million people worldwide. The bioavailability enhancement was based on the considerably improved dissolution. The release of a dose of 40 mg could be achieved within 15 min. Accordingly, administration of the nanofibrous system ensured an increased plasma concentration profile in rats in contrast to the practically non-absorbable crystalline flubendazole. Furthermore, easy-to-grind fibers could be developed, which enabled compression of easily administrable immediate release tablets.},

@article{You2017,
abstract = {Electrospinning is recognized as an efficient and versatile technique that has been widely used in nanoscale fiber fabrication. Electric field manipulation is one of the efficient ways to precisely control an electrospinning jet. While there have been several studies of the electric field manipulation effect on nanofiber deposition control, these works are limited to the control of a far-field electrospinning (FFES) jet to deposit in one dimension or to suppress the chaotic whipping mode to some extent. Few work has been done to control a near-field electrospinning (NFES) jet for deposition of complex patterns using electric field manipulation. To this end, we propose a novel design by adding a moving sharp-pin electrode beneath the plane collector. The sharp pin electrode is charged with a positive voltage and moved to redistribute the electric field for jet trajectory control, while the plane collector is kept stationary. The focusing of the electric field and the guiding effect of the jet trajectory due to the additional sharp-pin electrode are studied and demonstrated. Various parameters (voltage, electrode translation speed, and collection mechanism) are analyzed to experimentally study their effects on the fiber deposition control. It is demonstrated in the current work the feasibility of controlling a single fiber for deposition of complex patterns in near-field electrospinning by manipulating the electric field distribution.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses how sequential logic circuits work. In sequential logic the timing of events is important. To analyze the action of a sequential logic circuit, users need to know both the truth table and also the order in which events have occurred. The latching button changes immediately and holds its value, whereas the non-latching, or “momentary” switch drops back to 0V as soon as it is released. A bistable is also called a flip-flop on account of its two stable states or the way it can flip or flop from one state to the other. It can also be called a “latch,” just like the latch switch. Changing either input to logic 1 has no effect on the output state, and the circuit is said to be in a “memory” or “latch” state. Extremely short and difficult to detect pulses are called “glitches,” and the circuit designed to detect them is called a “glitch catcher.” One way of finding out whether this power supply failure occurs is by using a NAND latch to monitor the voltage.},

The text differs from other texts in its brevity; yet it provides coverage of the main topics usually studied in the standard course, as well as an introduction to using computer algebra packages to solve and understand partial differential equations. For the 3rd edition the section on numerical methods has been considerably expanded to reflect their central role in PDE's. A treatment of the finite element method has been included and the code for numerical calculations is now written for MATLAB. Nonetheless the brevity of the text has been maintained. To further aid the reader in mastering the material and using the book, the clarity of the exercises has been improved, more routine exercises have been included, and the entire text has been visually reformatted to improve readability.},

@article{Henriques2009,
abstract = {We assembled a new electrospinning apparatus and used poly(ethylene oxide) as a model polymer to perform a systematic study on the influence of solution and processing parameters on the morphology of electrospun nanofibers. Solution parameters studied were polymer concentration and molecular mass. The solvent used, 60 wt{\%} water, 40 wt{\%} ethanol, was the same throughout the study. Processing parameters analyzed were: solution feed rate, needle tip-collector distance and electrostatic potential difference between the needle and collector. Solution viscosity increased both with polymer concentration and molecular mass. Polymer concentration plays a decisive role on the outcome of the electrospinning process: a low concentration led to the formation of beaded fibers; an intermediate concentration yielded good quality fibers; a high concentration resulted in a bimodal size distribution and at even higher concentration a distributed deposition. Fiber diameter increased with polymer molecular mass and higher molecular masses are associated with a higher frequency of splaying events. Fiber diameter increased linearly with solution feed rate. While an increase in needle-collector distance represents a weaker electric field, a greater distance to be covered by the fibers and a longer flight time, presumably favoring the formation of thinner fibers, as solvent evaporation leads to a local increase of concentration and viscosity, viscoelastic forces opposing stretching caused an increase of fiber diameter with needle-collector distance. A higher voltage applied at the needle is associated with a higher charging of the polymer and a higher electrical current through it ultimately leading to incomplete solvent evaporation and merged fibers being produced. Controlling the charging of the polymer independently of the electric field strength was achieved by applying a voltage to the collector while distance and potential difference were kept constant. The increased electrostatic repulsion associated with an increase of the high voltage applied to the needle led to the disappearance of merged fibers.

abstract = {In nature, several available surfaces such as lotus leaves, rice leaves, butterfly wings, rose petals, gecko feet, spider, and fish scales exhibit an excellent hydrophobicity or superhydrophobicity. These surfaces with high water static contact angle ({\textgreater}150degrees) and low sliding angle exhibit the excellent antisticking, anticontamination, and self-cleaning characteristics. These properties are attractive for many industrial and biological applications such as antibiofouling paints, antisticking, self-cleaning windshields, microfluidics, metal refining, stain-resistant textiles, antifire cloths, and dust-free building glasses. Taking inspiration from the nature and increasing the demand of the artificial superhydrophobic surfaces for aforesaid applications, a research work for preparation and implementation of these surfaces needs to be done. Many well-known preparation techniques of superhydrophobic surfaces have been put forward by a large number of publications and diverse approaches. There are two main approaches for creating superhydrophobic surfaces: creating micro/nano-hierarchical structures on hydrophobic substrates and chemically modifying a hierarchical-structured surface with a low surface energy material (fatty acid, polymers, hydrocarbons, fluorocarbons). The various methods of synthesis of these surfaces have been reported in literature such as electrochemical deposition, phase separation, emulsion, electrospinning, immersion, chemical vapor deposition, wet chemical reaction, lithography, and others. Some of these synthesis techniques are simple and inexpensive; however, remaining is required multistep procedure and harsh conditions or specialized reagents and equipment, which leads to increase the cost of coating. This chapter provides the overview of the recent progress in the synthesis and difficulties arise during the implementation of superhydrophobic surfaces.},

abstract = {In electrospinning process, polymer nanofibers are formed with diameters in the submicron scale when a drop of viscoelastic polymer solution is subjected to a high voltage electrostatic field, when the charge force overcomes the surface tension of the solution, a beam is projected onto a collector. Among other parameters, the rheological properties of the polymer solution can significantly influence fiber formation during the electrospinning process, although this is well known, there is still no clear understanding of the effect of these properties to form fibers with morphology and structure consistent and controlled. The study was conducted for a system of SU-8 2002 (an epoxy-based negative photoresist) dissolved in cyclopentanone with poly(ethylene) oxide, PEO, and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate, TBATFB, as additives. The fibers were electrospun in an Electro Mechanical Spinning, EMS, platform. The rheological properties of the polymer solution were studied under shear conditions and combined with oscillatory data to get uniaxial deformation behavior using the Wagner constitutive equation. The elongational viscosity in the projected beam is estimated by using data from oscillatory tests. For this purpose, solutions of SU-8 2002 were tested and then electrospun systematically over a range of concentrations. It was found that the variation in concentration of the additives modifies the viscoelastic properties of the solutions and, therefore, the electrospinnability. As PEO concentration is increased the complex, elongational and shear viscosity also increases. For concentrations of TBATFB, the variation of the viscosities has not a clear behavior pattern. The most regular and thinnest fibers were those obtained from a concentration of 99.5, 0.25 and 0.25 wt percent. of SU-8 2002, PEO and TBATFB respectively. With the acquired information, process variables for the EMS such as fabrication velocity, voltage and tip-to-collector distance were improved.},

abstract = {Rapid hemostasis of solitary organs is still a big challenge in surgical procedures or after major trauma in both civilians and on the battlefield. Here, we report the first use of an airflow-directed in situ electrospinning method to precisely and homogeneously deposit a medical glue of n-octyl-2-cyanoacrylate (OCA) ultrathin fibers onto a wound surface to realize rapid hemostasis in dozens of seconds. In vivo and in vitro experiments on pig liver resection demonstrate that the self-assembled electrospun OCA membrane with high strength, good flexibility and integrity is very compact and no fluid seeping is observed even under a pressure of 147 mm Hg. A similar effect has been achieved in an in vivo experiment on pig lung resection. The results provide a very promising alternative for rapid hemostasis of solitary organs as well as other traumas, providing evidence that the postoperative drainage tube may not be always necessary for surgery in the near future. {\textcopyright} 2014 the Partner Organisations.},

The relationships between the current and printing parameters of voltage, frequency, and flow rate were deeply investigated, and the examination data and conclusion were obtained under the condition of the needle size remaining unchanged. Especially, the equation relationship between the flow rate and current was established, which can be used for the modification of the DoD E-Jet printing process. The map describing the stable printing range, droplet size, and current was also recognized, which can help us to select parameters for stable printing. Based on the current measurement and control system and the established relationship, the optimized current and printing parameters were chosen to print uniform graphene microstructures. This instrument provides an effective method for monitoring, adjusting, and controlling the DoD E-Jet printing process and further improving the quality of the printed structures for micro/nanoelectromechanical system (M/NEMS) devices.},

abstract = {The collaboration of a clinical neuropsychologist and a behavioral neurologist, Clinical Neuroanatomy expands upon similar texts by offering an exceptionally extensive review of higher cortical - behavioral functions and their anatomical substrates. While a major text for students and clinicians in neuropsychology, it is highly relevant for behavioral and traditional neurologists, neuropsychiatrists, and others who have an interest in exploring the mysteries of brain-behavior relationships. This book begins with a traditional review of the basic internal and external morphology, major nerve and fiber tracts, behavioral correlates, and clinical syndromes associated with spinal cord, brain stem, and cerebellum designed to reacquaint students and practicing clinicians with the functional anatomy of the subtentorial central nervous system. However, as the text was specifically geared to meet the needs of those practitioners whose primary interest is in what might be termed "higher order cognitive-behavioral funct on," the main focus of the text is on the brain itself. Borrowing heavily from a Lurian tradition, the central chapters reflect an attempt to offer more detailed, integrated, and, at times, theoretical models of cortical systems and their internal organization. Additional chapters highlight vascular anatomy and associated pathology, as well as neurochemical systems and their potential clinical relevance. The authors' teaching style enlivens the material with clinical examples and welcomed touches of subtle humor. -Nearly 300 illustrations help identify key structures and pathways, as well as providing clinical and pathological examples -Text emphasizes the suspected roles of CNS structures in normal behavior and common consequences of lesions affecting these structures. -Throughout the text, assessment techniques and guidelines are provided to aid in the examination of the various functional systems. -Separate sections review the basics of bioelectric and neurochemical transmission at the neuronal and synapti level. -Tables, footnotes, and an extensive glossary aid the reader in retaining, understanding, and finding points of particular interest. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

abstract = {Electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA), or simply Electrospraying is the process of influencing the breakup of a liquid into droplets by using a strong electric field. There can be different modes of Electrospraying depending, basically, on the created electric field strength and the liquid flowrate, for a specified liquid. Among these modes, the so-called cone-jet mode is the most explored one. This is due to its ability to produce highly charged monodisperse droplets in the nano- to micro-meter size range. Another mode of interest, which can also produce monodisperse droplets is the simple-jet mode. This mode is less explored when compared to the former. Within the papers that were explored by the authors, Agostinho et al. (2012) were the first authors to carefully investigate and characterize this mode. In their work, the authors reported about the influence of the electric field and the liquid flowrate on the droplets' size and spray dispersion. They also pointed out that the charge on these droplets can be expressed as a certain percentage of their Rayleigh limit. So far, there has been no model proposed to describe the droplets' trajectories in the simple-jet mode. This paper describes the design and the implementation of a physical model for determining the droplet trajectories in this mode. The model is done, specifically, for a single nozzle/ring-up configuration. It is a two-dimensional model, which solves the force balance equation for each droplet breaking up from the jet. It takes into consideration; the initial droplet velocity, the force of gravity, the electric field force, the inter-droplet coulombic force and the drag force. The droplets' deformation and reorientation were hypothesized, from observations, to play a major role in initiating the droplets' dispersion. They were simulated by implementing periodic displacements on the droplets' center of charge from its center of mass. The calculated droplets' trajectories' envelope angle was fitted to the experimental envelope angle by adjusting the droplet charge around the values that were reported by Agostinho et al. (2012). The model was validated by comparing the shapes of the theoretical and experimental sprays. The model offers new possibilities of modeling the droplets' trajectories in complex geometries, and of introducing additional forces to manipulate their trajectories in the simple-jet mode.},

abstract = {The source of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was traced to wildlife market civets and ultimately to bats. Subsequent hunting for novel coronaviruses (CoVs) led to the discovery of two additional human and over 40 animal CoVs, including the prototype lineage C betacoronaviruses, Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5; these are phylogenetically closely related to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV, which has affected more than 1,000 patients with over 35{\%} fatality since its emergence in 2012. All primary cases of MERS are epidemiologically linked to the Middle East. Some of these patients had contacted camels which shed virus and/or had positive serology. Most secondary cases are related to health care-associated clusters. The disease is especially severe in elderly men with comorbidities. Clinical severity may be related to MERS-CoV's ability to infect a broad range of cells with DPP4 expression, evade the host innate immune response, and induce cytokine dysregulation. Reverse transcription-PCR on respiratory and/or extrapulmonary specimens rapidly establishes diagnosis. Supportive treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and dialysis is often required in patients with organ failure. Antivirals with potent in vitro activities include neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, antiviral peptides, interferons, mycophenolic acid, and lopinavir. They should be evaluated in suitable animal models before clinical trials. Developing an effective camel MERS-CoV vaccine and implementing appropriate infection control measures may control the continuing epidemic.},

abstract = {1,3,5-Benzenetrisamides (BTAs) are a prominent class of low-molecular weight compounds in supramolecular chemistry. They are well-known to self-assemble into micro- and nanofibers in a bottom-up approach. At the same time, BTAs are also suitable for top-down processing by melt electrospinning. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that both approaches lead to mechanically robust BTA fibers. We compare self-assembled and electrospun fibers of N,N,N'-tripropyl-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxamide on multiple length scales. X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals the same crystal structure independently from the preparation method. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we observe significantly different morphologies of both fiber types on the sub-micron-scale. However, atomic force microscopy (AFM) bending experiments show that despite differences in morphology, Young's modulus is comparable for both types and in the lower GPa range (3-5 GPa).

@article{Frontera2012,
abstract = {Nanofibers of conducting polymers, as polyaniline (PANI), have received a great deal of attention by the scientific community for their potential applications (electronic, magnetic, biomedical, optical fields). Recently the electrospinning has emerged as a promising technique to produce wires and fibers of polymers with diameters ranging from 10 nm to 10$\mu$m. PANI has poor processability by electrospinning due to its poor solubility in common solvents, but it is possible to spun polyaniline nanofibers adding another polymer to the organic solutions. The presence of an insulator copolymer decreases the fibers/wires conductivity. In this work we report the preparation of highly pure polyaniline fibers by electrospinning process. PANI powder has been characterized by FT-IR, UV-VIS, and X-Ray diffraction. The spun sample obtained have been characterized by SEM to evaluate the wire morphology and complex impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in order to measure the electrical conductivity. We observed that, reducing the amount of PEO in the PANI/PEO blend organic solution, the fiber sizes decreased from 421nm for higher content of PEO (PANI: PEO= 1: 1, w/w) to 230 nm (PANI: PEO= 1: 0.1, w/w). The way to collect the fiber has been also investigated. Using a rotanting collector we observed a stretching effect on the fibers which promotes a narrow distribution of fibers dimension with respect to the fibers obtained with static collector. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A new method is reported for minimizing the inherent fiber instability in the electrospinning process. The method, dubbed "biased AC electrospinning", employs a combination of DC and AC potentials and results in highly-aligned mats of polymer or composite polymer fibers. The relationship between specific processing variables such as the AC frequency and the magnitude of the DC offset was investigated and related to the resulting fiber stability and uniformity. For optimum fiber stability, the AC frequency must fall within a relatively narrow range. The upper and lower frequency limits were measured for a small group of polymers and polymer composites and were qualitatively related to solution properties and processing variables. Potential applications of well-ordered nanofiber materials include tissue engineering, filtration, drug delivery, and microelectronics.},

However, nanofibers have enormous potential as wound dressings and other clinical applications that could have wide impacts on the treatment of wounds.

Readers will discover the benefits of numerical methods for solving complex mathematical problems and for the direct simulation of physical processes. The book is divided into two main parts: Deterministic methods and stochastic methods in computational physics. Based on concrete problems, the first part discusses numerical differentiation and integration, as well as the treatment of ordinary differential equations. This is extended by a brief introduction to the numerics of partial differential equations. The second part deals with the generation of random numbers, summarizes the basics of stochastics, and subsequently introduces Monte-Carlo (MC) methods. Specific emphasis is on MARKOV chain MC algorithms. The final two chapters discuss data analysis and stochastic optimization. All this is again motivated and augmented by applications from physics. In addition, the book offers a number of appendices to provide the reader with information on topics not discussed in the main text. Numerous problems with worked-out solutions, chapter introductions and summaries, together with a clear and application-oriented style support the reader. Ready to use C++ codes are provided online.},

abstract = {Several gas molecules of environmental and domestic significance exhibit a strong deep-UV absorption. Therefore, a sensitive and a selective gas detector based on this unique molecular property (i.e., absorption at a specific wavelength) can be developed using deep-UV absorption spectrophotometry. UV absorption spectrometry provides a highly sensitive, reliable, self-referenced, and selective approach for gas sensing. This review article addresses the recent progress in the application of deep-UV absorption for gas sensing owing to its inherent features and tremendous potentials. Applications, advancements, and challenges related to UV emission sources, gas cells, and UV photodetectors are assessed and compared. We present the relevant theoretical aspects and challenges associated with the development of portable sensitive spectrophotometer. Finally, the applications of UV absorption spectrometry for ozone, NO2, SO2, and aromatic organic compounds during the last decades are discussed and compared. A portable UV absorption spectrophotometer can be developed by using LEDs, hollow core waveguides (HCW), and UV photodetectors (i.e., photodiodes). LED provides a portable UV emission source with low power input, low-intensity drifts, low cost, and ease of alignment. It is a quasi-chromatic UV source and covers the absorption band of molecules without optical filters for absorbance measurement of a target analyte. HCWs can be applied as a miniature gas cell for guiding UV radiation for measurement of low gas concentrations. Photodiodes, on the other hand, offer a portable UV photodetector with excellent spectral selectivity with visible rejection, minimal dark current, linearity, and resistance against UV-aging.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We have developed an analysis pipeline to facilitate real-time mutation tracking in SARS-CoV-2, focusing initially on the Spike (S) protein because it mediates infection of human cells and is the target of most vaccine strategies and antibody-based therapeutics. To date we have identified fourteen mutations in Spike that are accumulating. Mutations are considered in a broader phylogenetic context, geographically, and over time, to provide an early warning system to reveal mutations that may confer selective advantages in transmission or resistance to interventions. Each one is evaluated for evidence of positive selection, and the implications of the mutation are explored through structural modeling. The mutation Spike D614G is of urgent concern; after beginning to spread in Europe in early February, when introduced to new regions it repeatedly and rapidly becomes the dominant form. Also, we present evidence of recombination between locally circulating strains, indicative of multiple strain infections. These finding have important implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenesis and immune interventions. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Summary: Numerical Optimization presents a comprehensive and up-to-date description of the most effective methods in continuous optimization. It responds to the growing interest in optimization in engineering, science, and business by focusing on the methods that are best suited to practical problems. For this new edition the book has been thoroughly updated throughout. There are new chapters on nonlinear interior methods and derivative-free methods for optimization, both of which are used widely in practice and the focus of much current research. Because of the emphasis on practical methods, as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is accessible to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text in engineering, operations research, mathematics, computer science, and business. It also serves as a handbook for researchers and practitioners in the field. The authors have strived to produce a text that is pleasant to read, informative, and rigorous - one that reveals both the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side.},

abstract = {Chronic viral hepatitis is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Here, we will briefly review common indications and current therapies for chronic hepatitis B and C and discuss practical aspects of these therapies. Current therapies for hepatitis C aim at viral eradication. With the introduction of pegylated interferon and ribavirin viral eradication is successful in about 55{\%} of treated patients. The goal of therapy of HBe antigen positive chronic hepatitis B is seroconversion to anti-HBe which can be achieved with interferon alpha in 25-45{\%} of patients. A loss of HBs can be achieved in approximately 10{\%}. Responders proceed significantly less to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-HBe positive patients can be treated with interferon alpha or lamivudine. The former requires longer treatment and the results are disappointing. Lamivudine is a promising agent in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, but the success is hampered by a high relapse rate and the emergence of viral resistance.},

abstract = {Electrospinning of emeraldine base polyaniline/polyacrylonitrile (PANI/PAN) blends with different composition ratios were performed using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent. The blends were electrospun at various electrospinning temperature and electric fields. Morphology and fibers diameters were investigated by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The average diameter of nanofibers and their distributions were determined from 100 measurements of the random fibers with image analyzer software (manual microstructure distance measurement). Electrical conductivity of the prepared mats was characterized using standard four point probe method. The fibers with diameter ranging from 60 to 600 nm were obtained. The PANI/PAN blends containing up to the PANI content of 30{\%} could be electrospun into the continuous fibrous structure, although pure PANI solution was not able to be electrospun into the fibrous structure. Average of fiber diameter decreased with increasing PANI content and electrospinning temperature. The electrospun PANI/PAN fibers at 50 °C and 75 °C showed smaller diameters with much better uniformity than those electrospun at 25 °C. The electrical conductivity of the mats increased with the increase of PANI content in the blend with percolation threshold of 0.5{\%}.},

It is shown that a combination of the van't Hoff isochore and Kirchhoff's equation are all that is necessary to simulate and curve fit the HSDSC output obtained for the thermally induced unfolding of the protein ubiquitin. The treatment is further developed to show how the temperature dependence of the heat capacity change of unfolding, multiple sequential transitions, and protein dissociation can be incorporated into the thermo-dynamic description of protein unfolding and how these factors in turn affect the HSDSC signal.},

These are not the familiar clashes between liberals and conservatives or the religious and the secular: instead, they are clashes between a new moral culture-victimhood culture-and a more traditional culture of dignity. Even as students increasingly demand trigger warnings and “safe spaces,” many young people are quick to police the words and deeds of others, who in turn claim that political correctness has run amok. Interestingly, members of both camps often consider themselves victims of the other. In tracking the rise of victimhood culture, Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning help to decode an often dizzying cultural milieu, from campus riots over conservative speakers and debates around free speech to the election of Donald Trump.},

@article{Walker2016,
abstract = {Both Vancouver, British Columbia, and Detroit, Michigan, have significant and growing urban agriculture movements. In this article, I follow recent work investigating the connection between urban agriculture and neoliberalization to determine how these local governments have used urban agriculture in narratives of economic development to selectively pursue a sustainability fix. I analyze how different regimes of local governance have influenced the urban agriculture movements, leading to local, hybridized fixes that adapt to different material and discursive contexts in each place. I argue that in both cities, urban agriculture has radical potential as a grassroots response to economic and environmental injustice, but has also been enrolled as a device by the local state in which the primary goal of sustainability planning becomes enhanced economic competitiveness. Pursuing an agenda of food justice requires examining the larger context and effects of municipal involvement with food movements.},

@article{Walker2019,
abstract = {Electroconductive hydrogels (ECHs) are highly hydrated three-dimensional (3D) networks generated through the incorporation of conductive polymers, nanoparticles, and other conductive materials into polymeric hydrogels. ECHs combine several advantageous properties of inherently conductive materials with the highly tunable physical and biochemical properties of hydrogels. Recently, the development of biocompatible ECHs has been investigated for various biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, biosensors, flexible electronics, and other implantable medical devices. Several methods for the synthesis of ECHs have been reported, which include the incorporation of electrically conductive materials such as gold and silver nanoparticles, graphene, and carbon nanotubes, as well as various conductive polymers (CPs), such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxyythiophene) into hydrogel networks. These electroconductive composite hydrogels can be used as scaffolds with high swellability, tunable mechanical properties, and the capability to support cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, recent advancements in microfabrication techniques such as 3D bioprinting, micropatterning, and electrospinning have led to the development of ECHs with biomimetic microarchitectures that reproduce the characteristics of the native extracellular matrix (ECM). The combination of sophisticated synthesis chemistries and modern microfabrication techniques have led to engineer smart ECHs with advanced architectures, geometries, and functionalities that are being increasingly used in drug delivery systems, biosensors, tissue engineering, and soft electronics. In this review, we will summarize different strategies to synthesize conductive biomaterials. We will also discuss the advanced microfabrication techniques used to fabricate ECHs with complex 3D architectures, as well as various biomedical applications of microfabricated ECHs.},

abstract = {Use of amphiphilic triblock copolymers to direct the organization of polymerizing silica species has resulted in the preparation of well-ordered hexagonal mesoporous silica structures (SBA-15) with uniform pore sizes up to approximately 300 angstroms. The SBA-15 materials are synthesized in acidic media to produce highly ordered, two-dimensional hexagonal (space group p6mm) silica-block copolymer mesophases. Calcination at 500°C gives porous structures with unusually large interlattice d spacings of 74.5 to 320 angstroms between the (100) planes, pore sizes from 46 to 300 angstroms, pore volume fractions up to 0.85, and silica wall thicknesses of 31 to 64 angstroms. SBA-15 can be readily prepared over a wide range of uniform pore sizes and pore wall thicknesses at low temperature (35°to 80°C), using a variety of poly(alkylene oxide) triblock copolymers and by the addition of cosolvent organic molecules. The block copolymer species can be recovered for reuse by solvent extraction with ethanol or removed by heating at 140°C for 3 hours, in both cases, yielding a product that is thermally stable in boiling water.},

Electrospinning, the most common method to produce such fibers, has many limitations including low fiber output and solvent dependency. Centrifugal spinning is a new technique that uses centrifugal forces to form nano- and microfibers both from solution and the melt. In this work, the effect of melt temperature, collector distance, rotation speed, and concentration (for polymer solutions) of polycaprolactone were evaluated with respect to fiber morphology, diameter, alignment, and crystallinity. The fiber diameter generally decreased with increasing rotation speed and reduced concentration. Crystallinity for spun fibers decreased compared to the bulk polymer. Fiber alignment was improved with rotation speed for the melt-spun fibers. The fiber mats were evaluated as tissue scaffolds with neuronal PC12 cells. The cells adhered and extended neurites along the fibers for both melt and solution-spun scaffolds.},

abstract = {The synthesis of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) via the reduction of tetrachloroauric acid by sodium citrate has become a standard procedure in nanotechnology. Simultaneously, gold-mediated reactions are gaining interest due to their catalytic properties, unseen in other metals. In this study, we have investigated the theoretical mechanism of this reaction under three different pH conditions (acid, mild acid, and neutral) and have corroborated our findings with experimental kinetic measurements by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the final particle morphology. We have demonstrated that, indeed, the pH of the medium ultimately determines the reaction rate of the reduction, which is the rate-limiting step in the Au NPs formation and involves decarboxylation of the citrate. The pH sets the dominant species of each of the reactants and, consequently, the reaction pathways slightly differ in each pH condition. The mechanism highlights the effect of the number of Cl - ligands in the metallocomplex, which ultimately originates the energetic differences in the reaction paths. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {When a child has difficulties eating or sleeping, or throws frequent tantrums, many parents cross their fingers and hope it's a phase to be outgrown soon. But when they persist, challenging behaviors can follow children to school, contributing to academic problems, social difficulties, and further problems in adolescence and adulthood. The authors of Evidence-Based Interventions for Children with Challenging Behavior take a preventive approach in this concise, well-detailed guide. Offering best practices from an extensive Response to Intervention (RTI) evidence base, the book provides guidelines for recognizing the extent of feeding, sleeping, toileting, aggression, and other issues, and supplies successful primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions with rationales. Case examples integrate developmental theories and behavior principles into practice, illustrate how strategies work, and show how to ensure that parents and caregivers can implement them consistently for maximum effect. Progress charts, content questions, and other helpful features make this an invaluable resource for students and professionalsalike. Included in the coverage: The prevention model and problem solving. Screening techniques. Evidence-based practices with children and their caregivers. Behavior principles and their application. Monitoring progress and evaluating outcomes. Plus helpful appendices, resource links, and other learning tools. Evidence-Based Interventions for Children with Challenging Behavior is an essential text for graduate students, scientist-practitioners/professionals, and researchers in child and school psychology; assessment, testing and evaluation; occupational therapy; family; educational psychology; and speech pathology.},

abstract = {I have heard many people over the years say that Python is an easy language to lean and that Python is also a simple language. To some extent both of these statements are true; but only to some extent. While the core of the Python language is easy to lean and relatively simple (in part thanks to its consistency); the sheer richness of the language constructs and flexibility available can be overwhelming. In addition the Python environment, its eco system, the range of libraries available, the often competing options available etc., can make moving to the next level daunting. Once you have learned the core elements of the language such as how classes and inheritance work, how functions work, what are protocols and Abstract Base Classes etc.},

@article{Xu2014,
abstract = {Developed from the far field electrospinning (FFES) process, near-field electrospinning (NFES) holds the promise to become a direct-writing technology with high throughput and multi-material capability not only in 2D but also in 3D space. The underlying problem is the deposition of fibers on top of each other. Since the fibers are of sub-micron size, the accuracy of the deposition must reach the same level to realize this requirement. Deposition inaccuracy is attributable to numerous sources including the residual charges remaining on the deposited fibers that repel the fiber being deposited as well as the inappropriate shape of the electric field guiding the deposition process. To eliminate these two influences, this paper proposes two possible solutions. In the first, the polarity of the electrodes is being switched in subsequent deposition passes, while in the second the ground electrode plate is replaced by a grounded pin to modify the shape of the electric field. A comparative experimental analysis of the feasibility of these two methods is presented and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.},

From a mechanics point of view, this plate can be modeled by means of the Kirchhoff equations of motion of a thin linear plate. This basic model allows us to understand the common points and differences between the natural acoustic reverberation and the plate reverberation. Measurements on a EMT140 plate reverb are also presented and compared to the model predictions. The identification and modelling of the different damping mechanisms in the plate allows us to relate the reverberation time Tr to the plate physical parameters. In addition to the comprehension of the physics of the plate reverb, this work will be useful for physical modelling sound synthesis of this audio effect.},

@article{Diaz2006,
abstract = {There are many technical situations, such as various biological or medical applications, in which a hydrophobic fluid must be encapsulated inside a hydrophilic polymer shell in the form of tiny microscopic pieces. A novel approach is presented, based on the co-electrospinning of the hydrophilic polymer melt (outside) and the hydrophobic fluid (inside), which results in beaded micro- and nanofibers, such that the hydrophobic fluid is efficiently encapsulated inside the beads. For the selected fluid couple, the low liquid-liquid surface tension and the high viscosity of the melt prevent the varicose break-up of inner fluid in the coaxial electrified jet until the very end of the co-electrospinning process. The resulting fibers present beads filled with the hydrophobic fluid, separated by a rather uniform distance whose length depends partially on the melt flow rate. The bead diameter grows with the inner flow rate, going from a monosized to a bisized distribution. In the case under study, the maximum relative (inner-to-outer) flow rate is one. The diameter of the solid fibers between beads scales well with existing theories for simple electrospinning.},

abstract = {MCM-41 siliceous molecular sieves were used to test the applicability of the Kelvin equation for nitrogen adsorption in cylindrical pores of the size from 2 to 6.5 nm. It was shown that the Kelvin equation for the hemispherical meniscus, corrected for the statistical film thickness, is in quite good agreement with an experimental relation between the pore size and the capillary condensation pressure. The agreement can be made quantitative in the pore size range from ca. 2 to 6.5 nm, if a simple correction to the Kelvin equation is introduced. The required statistical film thickness curve (t-curve) was calculated using nitrogen adsorption data for large pore MCM-41 samples and the obtained results were extrapolated using an adsorption isotherm for a macroporous silica gel. Moreover, an accurate analytical representation of the t-curve was found. Since both the corrected Kelvin equation for cylindrical pores and the t-curve have simple analytical forms, they can conveniently be used in a variety of methods to evaluate porosity. It was shown that the BJH method with the corrected Kelvin equation accurately reproduces pore sizes of MCM-41 materials. A comparison was made between the specific surface areas for the MCM-41 samples calculated on the basis of the BET equation and those obtained using other independent methods. The results strongly suggest that when nitrogen adsorption data are used, the BET method overestimates the specific surface area of siliceous materials. The latter conclusion was supported by the examination of the obtained statistical film thickness curve.},

Carvedilol (CAR), a BCS II class compound, served as the model drug while poly (vinylpyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate) (PVPVA64) was adopted as the fiber-forming polymer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging was used to study the morphology of HSES and SNES samples. Different homogenization techniques were compared to maximize homogeneity: mixing in plastic bags and in a high-shear granulator resulting in low-shear mixing (LSM) and high-shear mixing (HSM). Drug content and homogeneity of the tablets were measured by UV-Vis spectrometry, the results revealed acceptably low-dose fluctuations especially with formulations homogenized with HSM. Sieve analysis was used on the final LSM and HSM powder mixtures in order to elucidate the observed differences between tablet homogeneity. Tablets containing drug-loaded electrospun fibers were also studied by Raman mapping demonstrating evenly distributed CAR within the corpus.},

Social measurement often begins with assessments in ordered categories, with two cate- gories being a special case. To increase their reliability and validity, instruments are composed of multiple, distinct items which assess the same variable. Rasch mea- surement theory is used to assess the degree to which the design and administration of the instrument are successful and to diagnose problems which need correcting.

abstract = {Near-field electrospinning direct writing of array-nozzle is an efficient method for preparing large-area aligned fibers. However, electric field between the array-nozzle interferes with the stability and uniformity of near-field electrospinning, and little research has been done in this field. To clarify the electric field interference generated by array-nozzle, the experimental results compared with the simulation are discussed. In this work, electric field interference between the five-nozzle linear arrangement near-field electrospinning process was demonstrated by the initial ejection behavior, the electric field distribution of near-field electrospinning environment and the deposition spacing of fibers. In addition, we developed a simple and flexible method serving as a quantitative evaluation index for evaluating the degree of electric field interference. Then, the mapping effects of electric field interference of nozzle structure on the surface morphology and uniformity of aligned fibers were studied, including the number of nozzle, nozzle spacing and nozzle length with linear and toothed arrangement. According to the result of experiment and characterization, suitable arrayed nozzle parameters for stably direct-write aligned array pattern with near-field electrospinning were available, whose geometric parameters are linear two-nozzle with a nozzle spacing of 2 mm and a nozzle length of 6.35 mm. Finally, on the basis of our previous research, a microfluidic channel was successfully prepared on polydimethylsiloxane by two-nozzle cooperation, which verified the rationality of the geometry.},

abstract = {Glassy carbon nanofibers (GCNFs) are considered promising candidates for the fabrication of nanosensors for biosensing applications. Importantly, in part due to their great stability, carbon electrodes with sub-10 nm nanogaps represent an attractive platform for probing the electrical characteristics of molecules. The fabrication of sub-10 nm nanogap electrodes in these GCNFs, which is achieved by electrically stimulating the fibers until they break, was previously found to require fibers shorter than 2 µm; however, this process is generally hampered by the limitations inherent to photolithographic methods. In this work, to obtain nanogaps on the order of 10 nm without the need for sub-2 µm GCNFs, we employed a fabrication strategy in which the fibers were gradually thinned down by continuously monitoring the changes in the electrical resistance of the fiber and adjusting the applied voltage accordingly. To further reduce the nanogap size, we studied the mechanism behind the thinning and eventual breakdown of the suspended GCNFs by controlling the environmental conditions and pressure during the experiment. Following this approach, which includes performing the experiments in a high-vacuum chamber after a series of carbon dioxide (CO2) purging cycles, nanogaps on the order of 10 nm were produced in suspended GCNFs 52 µm in length, much longer than the {\~{}}2 µm GCNFs needed to produce such small gaps without the procedure employed in this work. Furthermore, the electrodes showed no apparent change in their shape or nanogap width after being stored at room temperature for approximately 6 months.},

abstract = {We herein report a high-resolution nanopatterning method using low voltage electromechanical spinning with a rotating collector to obtain aligned graphitized micro and nanowires for carbon nanomanufacturing. A small wire diameter and a small inter-wire spacing were obtained by controlling the electric field, the spinneret-to-collector distance, the pyrolysis parameters, the linear speed of the spinneret, the rotational speed of the collector. Using a simple scaling analysis, we show how the straightness and the diameter of the wires can be controlled by the electric field and the distance of the spinneret to the collector. A small inter-wire spacing, as predicted by a simple model, was achieved by simultaneously controlling the linear speed of the spinneret and the rotational speed of the collector. Rapid drying of the polymer nanowires enabled the facile fabrication of suspended wires over various structures. Patterned polyacrylonitrile wires were carbonized using standard stabilization and pyrolysis to obtain carbon nanowires. Suspended carbon nanowires with a diameter of {\textless}50 nm were obtained. We also established a method for making patterned, highly graphitized structures by using the aforementioned carbon wire structures as a template for chemical vapor deposition of graphite. This patterning technique offers high throughput for nano writing, which outperforms other existing nanopatterning techniques, making it a potential candidate for large-scale carbon nanomanufacturing.},

abstract = {We report on the fabrication of a novel class of lightweight materials, polyimide-graphene nanocomposites (0.01-5 vol {\%}), with tunable electrical conductivity. The graphene-polyimide nanocomposites exhibit an ultra-low graphene percolation threshold of 0.03 vol {\%} and maximum dc conductivity of 0.94 S/cm, which we attribute to excellent dispersion, extraordinary electron transport in the well-dispersed graphene, high number density of graphene nanosheets, and the interactions between the aromatic moieties of the polyimide and the carbon rings in graphene. The dc conductivity data are shown to follow the power-law dependence on the graphene volume fraction near the percolation threshold. The ac conductivity of the nanocomposites is accurately represented by the extended pair-approximation model. The exponent s of the approximation is estimated to be 0.45-0.61, indicating anomalous diffusion of charge particles and a fractal structure for the conducting phase, lending support to the percolation model. Lowerature dc conductivity of the nanocomposites is well-approximated by the thermal fluctuation-induced tunneling. Wide-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy were utilized to correlate the morphology with the electrical conductivity. The lack of maxima in X-ray indicates the loss of structural registry and short-range ordering.},

Here we report a powerful, yet economical approach that integrates the concepts of the parallel-electrode electrospinning with centrifugal dispersion to produce nanofibers with a high degree of alignment and uniformity at a large scale. We first demonstrated this approach with polyvinylidene fluoride to show how experimental parameters regulate fiber properties, and then with chitosan, a natural polymer, and polyethylene oxide, a synthetic polymer, to illustrate the versatility of the system. As a model application, we then demonstrated the significance of fiber alignment in improving the piezoelectric effect for voltage generation. The technique presented here may be used for mass production of aligned nanofibers of various polymers for a myriad of applications.},

In order to fabricate precise 3D micro/nanostructures, the factors influencing the processing accuracy need to be considered comprehensively and systematically. In this paper, we review the basis of TPP micro/nanofabrication, including mechanism of TPP, experimental set-up for TPP and scaling laws of resolution of TPP. Then, we discuss the factors influencing the processing accuracy. Finally, we summarize the methods reported lately to improve the processing accuracy from improving the resolution and changing spatial arrangement of voxels.},

abstract = {An investigation of the structure of carbons of different origin treated at temperatures between 1000 and 3000°C has shown that the graphitizing and non-graphitizing carbons form two distinct and well-defined classes. The differences in structure are apparent from the earliest stages of carbonization, and may be attributed mainly to the formation at low temperatures, in the non-graphitizing carbons, of a strong system of cross-linking uniting the crystallites. This leads to a random orientation of th{\`{e}} crystallites in a rigid, finely porous mass. In the graphitizing carbons the cross-linking is much weaker, the structure is more compact, and neighbouring crystallites have a strong tendency to lie in nearly parallel orientation. It is shown that crystallite growth occurs by the gradual displacement of whole layer-planes or even of groups of layer-planes. The pre-orientation existing in the graphitizing carbons facilitates this process, enabling the rearrangement of the layer-planes to take place by small stages. It is the principal factor favouring crystallite growth in the graphitizing carbons. In the non-graphitizing carbons crystallite growth is impeded both by the strong cross-linking between neighbouring crystallites and by their random orientation.},

abstract = {The interaction between silica and polyethylene oxide) (PEO) in water may appear trivial and. it is generally stated, that hydrogen bonding is responsible for the attraction. However, a literature search shows that there is not a consensus with respect to the mechanism behind the attractive interaction. Several papers claim that only hydrogen bonding is not sufficient to explain the binding. The silica-PEO interaction is interesting from an academic perspective and it is also exploited in the preparation of mesoporous silica, a material of considerable current interest. This study concerns the very early stage of synthesis of mesoporous silica under mild acidic conditions, pH 2-5, and the aim is to shed light on the interaction between silica and the PEO-containing structure directing agent. The synthesis comprises two steps. An organic silica source, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), is first hydrolyzed and Pluronic P123, a poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO) block copolymer, is subsequently added at different time periods following the hydrolysis of TEOS. It is shown that the interaction between the silica and the Pluronic is dependent both on the temperature and on the time between onset of TEOS hydrolysis and addition of the copolymer. The results show that the interaction is mainly driven by entropy, The effect of the synthesis temperature and of the time between hydrolysis and. addition of the copolymer on the final material is also studied. The material with the highest degree of mesoorder was obtained when the reaction was performed at 20 °C and the copolymer was added 40 h after the start of TEOS hydrolysis. It is claimed that the reason for the good ordering of the silica is that whereas particle formation under these conditions is fast, the rate of silica condensation is relatively low. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {This comprehensive textbook describes the synthesis, characterization and technical and engineering applications of polymers. Offering a broad and balanced introduction to the basic concepts of macromolecular chemistry and to the synthesis and physical chemistry of polymers, it is the ideal text for graduate students and advanced Masters students starting out in polymer science. Building on the basic principles of organic chemistry and thermodynamics, it provides an easily understandable and highly accessible introduction to the topic. Step by step, readers will obtain a detailed and well-founded understanding of this vibrant and increasingly important subject area at the intersection between chemistry, physics, engineering and the life sciences.Following an approach different from many other textbooks in the field, the authors, with their varying backgrounds (both from academia and industry), offer a new perspective. Starting with a clear and didactic introduction, the book discusses basic terms and sizes and shapes of polymers and macromolecules. There then follow chapters dedicated to polymers in solutions, molar mass determination, and polymers in the solid state, incl. (partially) crystalline or amorphous polymers as well as their application as engineering materials. Based on this information, the authors explain the most important polymerization methods and techniques. Often neglected in other textbooks, there are chapters on technical polymers, functional polymers, elastomers and liquid crystalline polymers, as well as polymers and the environment. An overview of current trends serves to generate further interest in present and future developments in the field.This book is the English translation of the successful German textbook "Polymere", which was awarded the Chemical Industry in Germany's 2015 literature Prize (“Literaturpreis des Fonds der Chemischen Industrie”) for its innovative, novel approach, and its good accessibility and readability, while at the same time providing comprehensive coverage of the field of polymer science.},

Catalytic substrate, which is devoid of expensive noble metals and enzymes for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), reduction reactions can be obtained via nitrogen doping of graphite. Here, we report a facile fabrication method for obtaining such nitrogen doped graphitized carbon using polyacrylonitrile (PAN) mats and its use in H2O2sensing. A high degree of graphitization was obtained with a mechanical treatment of the PAN fibers embedded with carbon nanotubes (CNT) prior to the pyrolysis step. The electrochemical testing showed a limit of detection (LOD) 0.609 $\mu$M and sensitivity of 2.54 $\mu$A cm−2mM−1. The promising sensing performance of the developed carbon electrodes can be attributed to the presence of high content of pyridinic and graphitic nitrogens in the pyrolytic carbons, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The reported results suggest that, despite their simple fabrication, the hydrogen peroxide sensors developed from pyrolytic carbon nanofibers are comparable with their sophisticated nitrogen-doped graphene counterparts.},

The effects of process parameters such as polymer concentration in solution, electrical field, diameter of the syringe needle, feed rate, and collector geometry on nanofibers were investigated. Statistical analysis is carried out using the Johnson SB distribution. A relation is proposed to relate the effect of the process parameters feed rate, electrical voltage, and tip to collector distance on the expected diameter of fibers. It is found that concentration and electrical field have a profound effect on the diameter of fibers compared to those of the syringe diameter and feed rate.},

abstract = {Human beta1-coronavirus ($\beta$1CoV) OC43 emerged relatively recently through a single zoonotic introduction. Like related animal $\beta$1CoVs, OC43 uses 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as receptor determinant. $\beta$1CoV receptor binding is typically controlled by attachment/fusion spike protein S and receptor-binding/receptor-destroying hemagglutinin-esterase protein HE. We show that following OC43's introduction into humans, HE-mediated receptor binding was selected against and ultimately lost through progressive accumulation of mutations in the HE lectin domain. Consequently, virion-associated receptor-destroying activity toward multivalent glycoconjugates was reduced and altered such that some clustered receptor populations are no longer cleaved. Loss of HE lectin function was also observed for another respiratory human coronavirus, HKU1. This thus appears to be an adaptation to the sialoglycome of the human respiratory tract and for replication in human airways.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

It addresses these aspects through a series of over 400 computer problems, ranging from elementary to research level to enable learning by doing. Students solve the problems in the same computational environment used for decades in science - the UNIX command line. This is available on all three major operating systems for PCs: Microsoft Windows, Mac-OSX, and Linux. To learn using this powerful system, students analyze sample sequence data by applying generic tools, bioinformatics software, and over 40 programs specifically written for this course. The solutions for all problems are included, making the book ideal for self-study. Problems are grouped into sections headed by an introduction and a list of new concepts and programs. By using practical computing to explore evolutionary concepts and sequence data, the book enables readers to tackle their own computational problems.},

abstract = {Natural nanostructures rarely come with a single biological function to fulfil. Moreover, from a bio-inspiration perspective, it sounds attractive to develop multifunctional coatings, devices or sensors. Suppression of light reflection from body parts, such as the wings of insects, is useful for hiding from predators. The transparent parts of the wings of Cacostatia ossa (moth) inherit their antireflective property from non-close-packed nano-scale nipple arrays on both sides of the wings. Through modelling and optical simulations, we show that effective medium approaches, commonly used to characterize antireflection, slightly overestimate the reflectance with respect to detailed Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis calculation. Coloration due to light interference in nanostructure, on the other hand, sometimes comes with an additional, unexpected and maybe non-biologically significant function: hygrochromism, i.e. change of color with humidity. The male Hoplia coerulea (beetle), for instance, exhibits iridescent blue-violet color which turns to emerald green when the elytron is put in contact with water. Impregnation experiments with various liquids revealed intriguing color change dynamics which could be related to the wetting properties of porous chitinous cuticle. Super-hydrophobicity is another function of biological significance, which helps, for instance, insects to keep dry in humid environments. Through morphological, optical and contact angle measurements, we show the existence of entangled levels of functionality on the wings of Cicada orni, namely a superhydrophobic stage at the upper part of the nipple array corrugated surface and an antireflective stage and the lower part.},

@article{Schwarzle2017,
abstract = {Two-photon crosslinking of polymers (2PC) is proposed as a novel method for the fabrication of freestanding microstructures via two-photon lithography. During this process in the confocal volume, two-photon absorption leads to (formal) C,H-insertion reactions, and consequently to a strictly localized crosslinking of the polymer. To achieve this, the polymer is coated as a solvent-free (glassy) film onto an appropriate substrate, and the desired microstructure is written by 2PC into this glass. In all regions outside of the focal volume where no two-photon process occurs, the polymer remains uncrosslinked and can be washed away during a developing process. Using a self-assembled monolayer containing the same photoreactive group allows covalent attachment of the forming freestanding structures to the substrate, and thus guarantees an improved stability of these structures against shear-induced detachment. As the two photon process is carried out in the glassy state, in a simple way, multilayer structures can be used to write structures having a varying chemical composition perpendicular to the surface. As an example, the 2PC process is used to build a structure from both protein-repellent and protein-adsorbing polymers so that the resulting 3D structure exhibits spatially controlled protein adsorption.},

Both bottom up and top down nanofabrication concepts were developed to produce nanofibers made of conjugated or other functional polymers and blends. This article summarizes and reviews the chemico-physical and functional requirements for polymer nanofibers to be used in opto- and nanoelectronics, as well as recent advances in various promising device architectures, such as light emitting and photovoltaic devices, photodetectors, field-effect transistors, piezo- and thermoelectric generators, and actuators. The outlook of functional polymer nanofibers and of devices based on them is also outlined and discussed.},

Small groups of Friesian cattle were offered forage as a group in several different situations which caused different degrees of competition for silage. Restriction of the number of mangers available to the cows and of the amount of silage offered encouraged a marked increase in rate of eating silage. In Experiment I when the cows were changed from individual mangers to group feeding their mean eating rate of silage increased from 43 to 71 g silage dry matter min−1. Results from the second experiment provided confirmation. In both experiments submissive cows increased their rate of eating to a greater extent than dominant animals. When group‐fed there was no significant correlation between degree of dominance and variation between cows in voluntary intake of silage, but milk yield and live weight were often directly correlated with silage intake. In Experiment 3 cows and heifers ate similar amounts of silage per unit live weight when group‐fed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1985, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

The experiment reveals that the deposition distance becomes larger when working distance and needle spacing increase, and the influence of voltage is relatively weaker. The deposition of double nozzle NFES has been studied with Coulomb's law and theoretical derivation has been verified by the experimental conclusion. The experiment result and theoretical derivation are helpful to get different distance of direct-written fibers by adjusting working distance or needle spacing to change distance of fibers largely and adjusting voltage to change distance slowly. Through these efforts, it is convenient to adjust the distance of straight fibers in multinozzle system.},

It describes methods of analysis from elementary mathematics to elementary mechanics and goes on to fundamental concepts of the mechanics of materials. It then covers the modeling of biosystems and provides a brief overview of tissue biomechanics. The author then introduces the concepts of biodynamics and human body modeling, looking at the fundamentals of the kinematics, the kinetics, and the inertial properties of human body models. He supplies a more detailed analysis of kinematics, kinetics, and dynamics of these models and discusses the numerical procedures for solving the governing dynamical equations. The book concludes with a review of a few example applications of biodynamic models such as simple lifting, maneuvering in space, walking, swimming, and crash victim simulation. The inclusion of extensive lists of problems of varying difficulty, references, and an extensive bibliography add breadth and depth to the coverage. Focusing on biodynamic modeling to a degree not found in other texts, this book equips readers with the expertise in biomechanics they need for advanced studies, research, and employment in biomedical engineering.},

abstract = {Electrospun fibers were produced using a variety of solvents to investigate the influence of polymer/solvent properties on the fiber surface morphology. Electrospinning is a novel processing technique for the production of fibers with diameters in the range of a few nanometers to tens of micrometers. We have been able to produce polymeric fibers with a high surface area through the introduction of a micro- and nanostructured surface structure, which we refer to as a "porous" morphology. These features could be introduced in several different polymeric fibers increasing their range of application significantly. The pores vary from densely packed, well-formed nanopores with diameters in the range 20-350 nm to larger flat pores of about 1 $\mu$m. The increased surface area of polymeric fibers was correlated with high volatility solvents used in the electrospinning process. The effect of processing parameters on the fiber surface morphology was also investigated using optical microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).},

abstract = {Populations around the world are growing and becoming predominately urban, fueling the need to re-examine how urban spaces are developed and urban inhabitants are fed. One remedy that is increasingly being considered as a solution to inadequate food access in cities, is urban agriculture. As a practice, urban agriculture is beneficial in both post-industrial and developing cities because it touches on the three pillars of sustainability: economics, society, and the environment. Historically, as well as currently, economic and food security are two of the most common reasons for participation in urban agriculture. Urban agriculture not only provides a source of healthful sustenance that might otherwise be lacking, it can also contribute to a household's income, offset food expenditures, and create jobs. Social facets are another reason for populations to engage in urban agriculture. A garden or rooftop farm is a place where people come together for mutual benefit, often enhancing the common social and cultural identity for city residents. Larger urban farms also participate in community enrichment through job training and other educational programmes, many of which benefit underserved populations. Finally, urban agriculture can play an important role in the environmental sustainability of a city. As a form of green infrastructure, urban farms and community food gardens help reduce urban heat island effects, mitigate urban stormwater impacts and lower the energy embodied in food transportation. This paper will describe a multi-year study undertaken by the Urban Design Laboratory at the Earth Institute to assess the opportunities and challenges associated with the development of urban agriculture in New York City (NYC). The paper will present metrics on potential growing capacity within the City inclusive of both rooftop and land-based options, results from a survey of New York City based urban farmers that gathered information on the challenges and barriers to food production in NYC, with a focus on rooftop farming, and data from an environmental monitoring study on a commercial rooftop farm in Brooklyn. The paper will use the results of the multi-year study to provide insight into the potential role of urban agriculture to creating a more sustainable food system for New York City and cities elsewhere.},

abstract = {Every process in physics is governed by selection rules that are the consequence of symmetry requirements. The beauty and strength of group theory resides in the transformation of many complex symmetry operations into a very simple linear algebra. This concise and class-tested book has been pedagogically tailored over 30 years MIT and 2 years at the University Federal of Minas Gerais (UFMG) in Brazil. The approach centers on the conviction that teaching group theory in close connection with applications helps students to learn, understand and use it for their own needs. For this reason, the theoretical background is confined to the first 4 introductory chapters (6-8 classroom hours). From there, each chapter develops new theory while introducing applications so that the students can best retain new concepts, build on concepts learned the previous week, and see interrelations between topics as presented. Essential problem sets between the chapters also aid the retention of the new material and for the consolidation of material learned in previous chapters. The text and problem sets have proved a useful springboard for the application of the basic material presented here to topics in semiconductor physics, and the physics of carbon-based nanostructures. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

@phdthesis{Kim2011,
abstract = {This thesis establishes comprehensive methodology for characterization of metallic nanowires (NWs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and evaluation of their performance for interconnect applications at microwave/ mm-wave/THz frequencies. The research focus is on the development of modeling and measurement methods to determine constitutive material parameters, i.e. conductivity, and contact resistance of platinum (Pt) NWs, as well as on the development of modeling approaches to evaluate characteristic parameters for antennas, nano-coaxial lines, and single wire transmission lines composed of CNTs. Applicability of traditional two-port measurements is investigated for accurate determination of material parameters for Pt NWs over a broad frequency range. Two test-setups are developed. First, several configurations with directly contacted Pt NWs to a host coplanar waveguide (CPW) structure are designed and realized to determine the conductivity and contact resistance. Full-wave finite element and circuit models are used to determine the two parameters by fitting simulations to measurements. It is found that the single measurement setup with direct contacts cannot determine the two parameters simultaneously. To solve this problem, two approaches based on transmission line and lumped element models for Pt NWs are developed. Both approaches employ a set of two NWs with different lengths. The feasibility of both approaches is thoroughly studied and relevant conclusions are made. An approach based on lumped element models is validated experimentally, and it is shown that the contact resistance and conductivity of 300 nm diameter Pt NWs are about 50 Ω and 0.013$\sigma$bulk, respectively. In the second setup, the capacitive coupling contact between the Pt NWs and the CPW structure is exploited to determine the NW's conductivity. Two variations of this setup, specifically in-slot and on-dielectric configurations, are developed. Full-wave finite-element models are utilized to demonstrate suitability of the two configurations and to determine the conductivity of Pt NWs by fitting to measurements. Structural and elemental analyses of fabricated devices are conducted to assess fabrication and measurement issues. Full-wave modeling for individual CNTs and CNT bundles is performed by the use of method of moments and finite element method codes in order to CNTs as antennas, nano-coaxial lines, and single wire transmission lines. Characteristic parameters, such as impedance, gain, efficiency, and line loss for each interconnect are evaluated and compared to those of their copper-based counterparts. Results show better performance of CNTs over conventional metals at microwave frequencies. The extension of modeling and metrology for semiconducting NWs and CNTs, and the study of graphene at microwave frequencies are proposed as directions for future work.},

abstract = {Optical metasurfaces are judicously engineered electromagnetic interfaces that can control and manipulate many of light's quintessential properties, such as amplitude, phase, and polarization. These artificial surfaces are composed of subwavelength arrays of optical antennas that experience resonant light-matter interaction with incoming electromagnetic radiation. Their ability to arbitrarily engineer optical interactions has generated considerable excitement and interest in recent years and is a promising methodology for miniaturizing optical components for applications in optical communication systems, imaging, sensing, and optical manipulation. However, development of optical metasurfaces requires progress and solutions to inherent challenges, namely large losses often associated with the resonant structures; large-scale, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible nanofabrication techniques; and incorporation of active control elements. Furthermore, practical metasurface devices require robust operation in high-temperature environments, caustic chemicals, and intense electromagnetic fields. Although these challenges are substantial, optical metasurfaces remain in their infancy, and novel material platforms that offer resilient, low-loss, and tunable metasurface designs are driving new and promising routes for overcoming these hurdles. In this review, we discuss the different material platforms in the literature for various applications of metasurfaces, including refractory plasmonic materials, epitaxial noble metal, silicon, graphene, phase change materials, and metal oxides. We identify the key advantages of each material platform and review the breakthrough devices that were made possible with each material. Finally, we provide an outlook for emerging metasurface devices and the new material platforms that are enabling such devices.},

Many organizations are introducing senior positions in asset management, and universities are introducing courses in asset management at graduate and advanced undergraduate level. The broad reach of this book means that it will be applicable to professionals and future professionals across a wide variety of industries, ranging from manufacturing and distribution, to local government. The general principles of physical asset management are discussed in a manner which makes them accessible to a wide audience, and covers all stages of the asset management process, including: initial business appraisal; identification of fixed asset needs; financial evaluation; logistic support analysis; life cycle costing; maintenance strategy; outsourcing; cost-benefit analysis; disposal; and renewal. Physical Asset Management addresses the needs of existing and potential asset managers, and provides an introduction to asset management for professionals in related disciplines, such as finance.

We performed a difference-in-differences analysis of the effects of this programme on crime in and around newly treated lots, in comparison to crimes in and around randomly selected and matched, untreated vacant lot controls. The effects of two types of vacant lot treatments on crime were tested: a cleaning and greening 'stabilisation' treatment and a 'community reuse' treatment mostly involving community gardens. The combined effects of both types of vacant lot treatments were also tested. After adjustment for various sociodemographic factors, linear and Poisson regression models demonstrated statistically significant reductions in all crime classes for at least one lot treatment type. Regression models adjusted for spatial autocorrelation found the most consistent significant reductions in burglaries around stabilisation lots, and in assaults around community reuse lots. Spill-over crime reduction effects were found in contiguous areas around newly treated lots. Significant increases in motor vehicle thefts around both types of lots were also found after they had been greened. Community-initiated vacant lot greening may have a greater impact on reducing more serious, violent crimes.},

abstract = {The lack of a low cost, high volume method to produce carbon nanotubes has greatly limited their commercialization. Carbon nanofibers have a similar structure and properties as nanotubes and are a commercially viable alternative to them. In recent years many of the difficulties of commercial nanofiber production have been overcome through innovations in their manufacturing process. It is now possible to produce carbon nanofibers of different grades, such as thinner and thicker walled ones, and low heat treated and high heat treated ones. Most significantly, commercial quantities can now be produced of carbon nanofibers that have been surface functionalized with carboxylic acid groups, making them suitable for further functionalization and new classes of applications, such as biomedical sensors and drug delivery. Despite their cost advantages and availability more widespread use of carbon nanofibers has been hampered by uncertainties in their molecular structure and a lack of physical property measurements. However, recent theoretical and experimental studies have addressed these deficiencies showing that these fibers have a cone-helix structure under the usual manufacturing conditions. Additionally, small amounts of a segmented carbon nanotube structure, commonly called a bamboo structure, are also present. When the conical nanofibers were heat treated they were found to transform to a stacked cone structure. Advances in surface functionalization have allowed a variety of groups to be incorporated on them, significantly enhancing their properties and potential applications. Finally, the recent development of a new method to measure the elastic properties and morphology of single nanofibers has clearly demonstrated the high strength of these fibers. These nanofibers now represent a well understood and well characterized graphitic carbon nanomaterial that can be manufactured at low cost in large quantities, and have the potential to bring widespread use of nanotechnology to a variety of fields.},

abstract = {In this research, two types of core-shell nanofibers, epoxy-polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and mercaptan-PAN were successfully fabricated using single nozzle electrospinning. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed absence of chemical reaction between the encapsulated epoxy or mercaptan and PAN. Moreover, transmittance electron microscopy (TEM) images proved that the encapsulated epoxy and mercaptan were uniformly distributed within core of the nanofibers. Hybrid core-shell nanofibers mat was produced through twin electrospinning of epoxy-PAN and mercaptan-PAN on the same collector. Solidification of released core materials leads to repair a damaged area which could be used in epoxy composites for self-healing application. Degree of curing of epoxy resin was obtained to be 0.7 at 10 °C, proving that the dual component healing agent, epoxy and mercaptan is a suitable self-healing system in sub-room temperature. This research shows that solubility parameter of the materials plays a major role in the formation mechanism of core-shell nanofibers.},

@article{Park2020,
abstract = {Near-field electrospinning (NFES) was developed to overcome the intrinsic instability of traditional electrospinning processes and to facilitate the controllable deposition of nanofibers under a reduced electric field. This technique offers a straightforward and versatile method for the precision patterning of two-dimensional (2D) nanofibers. However, three-dimensional (3D) stacked structures built by NFES have been limited to either micron-scale sizes or special shapes. Herein, we report on a direct-write 3D NFES technique to construct self-aligned, template-free, 3D stacked nanoarchitectures by simply adding salt to the polymer solution. Numerical simulations suggested that the electric field could be tuned to achieve self-aligned nanofibers by adjusting the conductivity of the polymer solution. This was confirmed experimentally by using poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solutions containing 0.1-1.0 wt{\%} NaCl. Using 0.1 wt{\%} NaCl, nanowalls with a maximum of 80 layers could be built with a width of 92 ± 3 nm, height of 6.6 ± 0.1 $\mu$m, and aspect ratio (height/width) of 72. We demonstrate the 3D printing of nanoskyscrapers with various designs, such as curved "nanowall arrays", nano "jungle gyms," and "nanobridges". Further, we present an application of the 3D stacked nanofiber arrays by preparing transparent and flexible polydimethylsiloxane films embedded with Ag-sputtered nanowalls as 3D nanoelectrodes. The conductivity of the nanoelectrodes can be precisely tuned by adjusting the number of 3D printed layers, without sacrificing transmittance (98.5{\%}). The current NFES approach provides a simple, reliable route to build 3D stacked nanoarchitectures with high-aspect ratios for potential application in smart materials, energy devices, and biomedical applications.},

New to the second edition are treatments of geometrically nonlinear analysis and limit analysis based on nonlinear inelastic analysis. Illustrative examples of nonlinear behavior generated with advanced software are included. The book fosters an intuitive understanding of structural behavior based on problem solving experience for students of civil engineering and architecture who have been exposed to the basic concepts of engineering mechanics and mechanics of materials. Distinct from other undergraduate textbooks, the authors of Fundamentals of Structural Engineering, 2/e embrace the notion that engineers reason about behavior using simple models and intuition they acquire through problem solving. The perspective adopted in this text therefore develops this type of intuition by presenting extensive, realistic problems and case studies together with computer simulation, allowing for rapid exploration of how a structure responds to changes in geometry and physical parameters. The integrated approach employed in Fundamentals of Structural Engineering, 2/e make it an ideal instructional resource for students and a comprehensive, authoritative reference for practitioners of civil and structural engineering.},

abstract = {A mechano-electrospinning method is presented to direct-write oriented nanofiber with high deposition accuracy in continuously tunable manner. This method uses a large nozzle to deposit high-resolution fiber-arrays by near-field localization. Due to the existence of mechanical drawing force, a higher resolution pattern can be direct-written by a lower voltage, which just keeps the Taylor cone stable. Then the fiber is stretched through a moving substrate, by which the deposited fiber can be continuously tuned from 400 nm to 200 nm in a linear relationship. The effects of the speed on the diameter and morphology of fibers are studied, and the analysis of the mechanism of the fiber alignment is given. The positionability and controllability make mechano-electrospinning very different from the traditional electrospinning, which only collects the fibers in the form of nonwoven fabric. In addition, the fibers fabricated by this method can directly deposit over a large flat area in the form of arrays and complex patterns with high precision.},

The Primer is designed to provide up-to-date information about the major clinical syndromes. It is one of the most prestigious and comprehensive texts on arthritis and related diseases, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, lupus and more than one hundred others. It offers medical students and physicians a concise description of the current science, diagnosis, clinical consequences, and principles of management. Now entering its eighth decade, the 13th Edition of The Primer strongly rejects the notion "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". New and expanded chapters heighten the translational nature of this edition, and color figures depict cutaneous findings and histopathology. In view of the recent remarkable strides in understanding and treating rheumatic disease, students, trainees, and practicing clinicians all need a standard textbook that can change with the times and reflect these advances. The Primer continues to fill that need. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008. All rights reserved.},

Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

Herein, we present suspended monolithic carbon single nanowires and nanomeshes bridging two bulk carbon posts, fabricated in a designed manner using two successive UV exposure steps and a single pyrolysis step. The pyrolysis step is accompanied with a significant volume reduction, resulting in the shrinkage of micro-sized photoresist structures into nanoscale carbon structures. Even with the significant elongation of the suspended carbon nanowire induced by the volume reduction of the bulk carbon posts, the resultant tensional stress along the nanowire is not significant but grows along the wire thickness; this tensional stress gradient and the bent supports of the bridge-like carbon nanowire enhance structural robustness and alleviate the stiction problem that suspended nanostructures frequently experience. The feasibility of the suspended carbon nanostructures as a sensor platform was demonstrated by testing its electrochemical behavior, conductivity-temperature relationship, and hydrogen gas sensing capability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Lim et al.},

abstract = {Market research can be a complicated and complex process nowadays, especially when it involves sophisticated techniques with names like probabilistic sampling, Box-Jenkins, or conjoint analysis. There is a need for a guide that will help managers determine the dimensions of the task, the resources that must be summoned, the data required, and other key elements. Here, from the head of market research at General Motors, is such a guide in outline form. Vincent P. Barabba walks the reader through the five major stages of the research effort. Each stage is represented in one table, and together the tables combine into a mammoth foldout for easy perusal. The stages are: 1. Assess the market information needs. 2. Measure the marketplace. 3. Store, retrieve, and display the data. 4. Describe and analyze market information. 5. Evaluate the research and assess its usefulness. Comprehensiveness is a hallmark of the "encyclopedia." In the second table, for example, one of the headings under "nonprobabilistic data" is "central location interviewing." Barabba lists the limitations of this kind of research: "Very expensive; responses in this artificial environment may not reflect responses in the market; complicated logistics; development of test product can be time consuming and expensive."},

abstract = {Electrospinning is a straightforward and versatile method to fabricate ultrafine fibers with unique physical and chemical properties. However, the chaotic nature of traditional electrospinning limits its applications in devices which usually need arranged or patterned micro/nanoscale fibrous structures. In order to improve the controllable deposition of electrospun fibers, near-field electrospinning (NFES) has been proposed and developed in recent years. With characteristics of position-controlled deposition, NFES significantly expands the range of fiber-fabrication uses including electronic components, energy harvesting, flexible sensors, and tissue engineering. In this paper, the basic principle and research advances of NFES have been briefly reviewed. In particular, we summarize the process parameters, polymer materials, as-spun fibrous structures, modified apparatus, and potential applications of NFES. Finally, future prospects on the development tendency and challenges of NFES are discussed.},

abstract = {A variety of nanostructured materials are produced through template-based synthesis methods, including zero-dimensional, one-dimensional, and two-dimensional structures. These span different forms such as nanoparticles, nanowires, nanotubes, nanoflakes, and nanosheets. Many physical characteristics of these materials such as the shape and size can be finely controlled through template selection and as a result, their properties as well. Reviewed here are several examples of these nanomaterials, with emphasis specifically on the templates and synthesis routes used to produce the final nanostructures. In the first section, the templates have been discussed while in the second section, their corresponding synthesis methods have been briefly reviewed, and lastly in the third section, applications of the materials themselves are highlighted. Some examples of the templates frequently encountered are organic structure directing agents, surfactants, polymers, carbon frameworks, colloidal sol–gels, inorganic frameworks, and nanoporous membranes. Synthesis methods that adopt these templates include emulsion-based routes and template-filling approaches, such as self-assembly, electrodeposition, electroless deposition, vapor deposition, and other methods including layer-by-layer and lithography. Template-based synthesized nanomaterials are frequently encountered in select fields such as solar energy, thermoelectric materials, catalysis, biomedical applications, and magnetowetting of surfaces.},

abstract = {Nanowire sensors offer great potential as highly sensitive electrochemical and electronic biosensors because of their small size, high aspect ratios, and electronic properties. Nevertheless, the available methods to fabricate carbon nanowires in a controlled manner remain limited to expensive techniques. This paper presents a simple fabrication technique for sub-100 nm suspended carbon nanowire sensors by integrating electrospinning and photolithography techniques. Carbon Microelectromechanical Systems (C-MEMS) fabrication techniques allow fabrication of high aspect ratio carbon structures by patterning photoresist polymers into desired shapes and subsequent carbonization of resultant structures by pyrolysis. In our sensor platform, suspended nanowires were deposited by electrospinning while photolithography was used to fabricate support structures. We have achieved suspended carbon nanowires with sub-100 nm diameters in this study. The sensor platform was then integrated with a microfluidic chip to form a lab-on-chip device for label-free chemiresistive biosensing. We have investigated this nanoelectronics label-free biosensor's performance towards bacterial sensing by functionalization with Salmonella-specific aptamer probes. The device was tested with varying concentrations of Salmonella Typhimurium to evaluate sensitivity and various other bacteria to investigate specificity. The results showed that the sensor is highly specific and sensitive in detection of Salmonella with a detection limit of 10 CFU mL−1. Moreover, this proposed chemiresistive assay has a reduced turnaround time of 5 min and sample volume requirement of 5 µL which are much less than reported in the literature.},

abstract = {HYPOTHESIS The electrostatic initiation of a jet from the meniscus of a polymeric solution is a key step in near-field electrospinning (NFES), however this process is not sufficiently understood to determine a criterion for the critical emitter voltage triggering the jet, nor to optimize the electrodes. It is expected that the jet initiation in NFES is similar to that in cone-jet electrosprays, and can be described with a first principles model. EXPERIMENTS The electrostatic jet initiation of an SU-8 polymeric solution is studied with two different electrode geometries to quantify the initiation parameters and illustrate the optimization of the electric field. A first-principles model is developed to predict and analyze the initiation. FINDINGS Two jet emission mechanisms are identified: one in which the jet is ejected from a free-standing conical meniscus; and one resulting from the contact of the meniscus with the collector, as it evolves from a spherical to a conical shape. Both are triggered by a critical emitter potential. The former produces the thinnest jets with a diameter that depends on the properties of the fluid, while the latter is an alternative to existing mechanical initiation methods. The model reproduces well the experimental phenomena including the critical voltage.},

It is generally considered that DCES is the solely technique to produce nanofibers using the electrostatic force from polymer solutions, however, less studied and also capable ACES provides further advantages such as increased specific productivities. A poorly water-soluble drug (carvedilol) was incorporated into the fibers based on three different polymeric matrices (an acid-soluble terpolymer (Eudragit{\textregistered} E), a base-soluble copolymer (Eudragit{\textregistered} L 100-55) and a nonionic homopolymer (polyvinylpyrrolidone K90)) to improve the dissolution of the weak base drug under different pH conditions. Morphology and fiber diameter evaluation showed similar electrospun fibers regardless the type of the high voltage and the major differences in feeding rates. The amorphous ACES and DCES fibers provided fast and total drug dissolutions in all cases. The presented results show that ACES can be a more feasible novel alternative to formulate fibers for drug delivery purposes.},

abstract = {This study presents a novel droplet-jet mode of near-field electrospinning which allows microscale control of helix patterns using nanofiber. While the cone-jet mode has been used to generate a printable nanofiber to date, the cone-jet mode requires a high applied voltage with a long jet travel distance to obtain the nanofiber, resulting in a large coiling diameter. In order to integrate the near-field electrospinning into microscale devices, it is important to achieve a comparable nanofiber pattern resolution. Herein, we have demonstrated printing of nanofibers with a coiling diameter of sub-10 $\mu$m, which is produced by the droplet-jet mode of near-field electrospinning. Also, it is found that the coiling diameter, wavelength, and frequency can be controlled by the droplet size as one of the process parameters in the droplet-jet mode. The droplet-jet mode will be a promising near-field electrospinning technique to apply direct-written nanofibers to various micro-scale applications.},

@book{Hall2018,
abstract = {For the past 150 years, economics has been treated as a social science in which economies are modeled as a circular flow of income between producers and consumers. In this "perpetual motion" of interactions between firms that produce and households that consume, little or no accounting is given of the flow of energy and materials from the environment and back again. In the standard economic model, energy and matter are completely recycled in these transactions, and economic activity is seemingly exempt from the Second Law of Thermodynamics. As we enter the second half of the age of oil, and as energy supplies and the environmental impacts of energy production and consumption become major issues on the world stage, this exemption appears illusory at best. In Energy and the Wealth of Nations, concepts such as energy return on investment (EROI) provide powerful insights into the real balance sheets that drive our "petroleum economy." Hall and Klitgaard explore the relation between energy and the wealth explosion of the 20th century, the failure of markets to recognize or efficiently allocate diminishing resources, the economic consequences of peak oil, the EROI for finding and exploiting new oil fields, and whether alternative energy technologies such as wind and solar power meet the minimum EROI requirements needed to run our society as we know it. This book is an essential read for all scientists and economists who have recognized the urgent need for a more scientific, unified approach to economics in an energy-constrained world, and serves as an ideal teaching text for the growing number of courses, such as the authors' own, on the role of energy in society.},

abstract = {The cyclotriphosphazene-based epoxy resin hexa-[4-(glycidyloxycarbonyl) phenoxy]cyclotriphosphazene defined as CTP-EP was successfully synthesized from hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and epichlorohydrin. Its chemical structure was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and 31 P NMR spectroscopy. The prepared compound was cured with diamino diphenyl methane (DDM), diamino diphenyl sulfone (DDS) and m-phenylenediamine (mPDA), respectively. The flame retardant properties, thermal degradation behavior and flame retardant mechanism of the cured CTP-EP were investigated. The LOI values of all cured CTP-EP samples increased from 19.9{\%} for cured diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) to above 30{\%} and successfully passed UL-94 V-0 rating, which demonstrated that the prepared CTP-EP thermoset exhibited excellent flame retardancy. The dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMA) test demonstrated that the glass transition temperature (Tg) enhanced from 155 °C for the cured DGEBA to 167 °C for CTP-EP thermoset. The results of thermogravimetric analysis/infrared spectrometry (TG-IR) tests suggested that the phosphazene group and high aromatic content in CTP-EP thermoset stimulated the dehydration of the matrix at earlier degradation process and the formation of char layer, which retarded the release of pyrolysis gas and enhanced the thermal stability of the cured CTP-EP at high temperature. The cone calorimeter tests (cone) test revealed that heat release rate (HRR), total heat release (THR), smoke production rate (SPR) and total heat production (TSP) of the cured CTP-EP decreased significantly compared with the cured DGEBA. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that the phosphazene groups in CTP-EP obviously stimulated the formation of the intumescent, compact and stable char layer, which enhanced the flame retardancy of the matrix during combustion. Consequently, the underlying materials were protected from further degradation and combustion during a fire and result in the efficient flame retardancy of CTP-EP thermoset. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Porous materials appear widely in nature and are the subject of intense study in many research areas owing to their unique properties. Their ability to interact with atoms, ions and molecules has lead to their wide spread applicability in sorption, catalysis, chromatography, ion exchange, micro-electronics, environmental technology, controlled drug release, . . . In the field of porous materials, scientists aim to control the size, shape, uniformity and periodicity of porous space and the atoms and molecules that define it. By controlling and fine-tuning these properties, materials can be engineered to meet the desired function and behaviour in a particular application. The presented research work describes the development, characterization and catalytic application of diastereoisomeric olefinic periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs). PMOs are very unique in their compositional structure. The organic groups are covalently bonded within the siliceous network and hence are an intrinsic constituent of the mesoporous framework. The high loading and uniform distribution of organic groups in the pore walls of these open porous structures is a distinctive feature which allows for the easy tailoring of the PMO properties. From this perspective olefinic PMOs are very appealing, as they offer plenty of opportunities for surface modification based on olefin chemistry. To date, only limited research has been done on these very promising type of organic-inorganic hybrid materials and their potential in various applications has not been explored yet. The main goal of this research work has been the development of a novel class of versatile olefinic PMOs, which consist of diastereoisomerically configured organic bridges in their pore walls. The aim was to investigate new synthesis strategies which enable the synthesis of highly stable hybrid materials with controllable chemical and physical properties. By means of a detailed analysis of the developed PMO materials, an effort has also been made to understand the complex mechanisms involved in the supramolecular self-assembly process of ethenylene-bridged PMOs. Furthermore, with the intent of expanding the scope of olefinic PMOs, both the synthesis of new materials and the application thereof in catalysis has been studied.},

abstract = {Solution blow spinning (SBS) is a novel technology feasible to produce nanostructured polymeric membranes loaded with active agents. In the present study, nanofibrous mats of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) loaded with progesterone (P4) were produced by SBS at different P4 concentrations. The spun membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The in vitro releasing of P4 was evaluated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Interactions between progesterone and PLA were confirmed by rheological measurements of the PLA/P4 solutions and in the spun mats by microscopy (SEM), thermal (DSC) and spectral (FTIR) analyses. SEM micrographs provided evidences of a smooth and homogeneous structure for nanostructured membranes without progesterone crystals on fiber surface. FTIR spectroscopy indicated miscibility and interaction between the ester of PLA and the ketone groups of the P4 in the nanofibers. X-ray analysis indicated that the size of PLA crystallites increased with progesterone content. Finally, by in vitro release experiments it was possible to observe that the progesterone releasing follows nearly first-order kinetics, probably due to the diffusion of hormone into PLA nanofibers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Aim: The purpose of this study was to characterise the enamel surface of sound deciduous teeth in terms of morphology, chemical composition, structure and crystalline phases. Materials and Methods: The enamel of 30 human deciduous teeth was examined by: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Chemical differences between incisors and canines were statistically evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test (p≤0.05). Results: Three enamel patterns were observed by SEM: "mostly smooth with some groves", "abundant microporosities" and "exposed prisms". The average Ca/P molar ratios were 1.37 and 1.03 by EDS and XPS, respectively. The crystallite size determined by XRD was 210.82±16.78 {\AA}. The mean ratio between Ca bonded to phosphate and Ca bonded to hydroxyl was approximately 10:1. Conclusion: The enamel of sound deciduous teeth showed two main patterns: "mostly smooth with some groves" and "abundant microporosities". "Exposed prisms" was a secondary pattern. There were slight variations among the Ca/P molar ratios found by EDS and XPS, suggesting differences in the mineral content from the enamel surface to the interior. The crystalline phases found in enamel were hydroxyapatite and carbonate apatite, with major type B than type A carbonate incorporation.},

abstract = {An in vitro digestion method to assess the quality of proteins based on enzymatic hydrolysis is presented. The method consists of a two-step proteolysis at 37 degrees, a 30-minute incubation of the protein with pepsin at pH 1.9, followed by pancreatin digestion at pH 8 for 24 hours in a dialysis bag with a 1000 molecular weight cutoff for the continuous elimination of the digested products into a replaceable buffer. Three types of buffer replacement were tried. These were, in increasing order of efficiency: intermittent with either six changes (infrequent buffer replacement) or eleven changes (frequent buffer replacement) or continuously circulated at the rate of 212 ml/hour (continuous buffer replacement). By using three protein sources, i.e., casein, soybean and rapeseed proteins, it was found that the degree of digestion (dialyzed N) as well as the regularity of the process were markedly improved by increasing the frequency of buffer replacement. In spite of different pepsin digestibilities, as determined from the production of trichloroacetic acid-soluble N, the digestion of the three proteins gave equivalent results when the best procedure of buffer replacement was used (continuous buffer replacement). The deleterious effect of heat and alkali treatment on protein digestion was readily shown by this procedure and indicated casein to be a very heat-sensitive protein as compared to the others.},

We propose that urban agriculture has three elements: urban agriculture in isolation; its interface with the people and environment within which it is situated; and its contribution to the design of built form. Additionally, we consider its scale: micro, meso and macro. The analysis draws attention to legal, social and economic constraints and opportunities. It suggests that future priorities for research should be directed towards (i) strategically identifying principles of sustainable urban agriculture that help policy makers to design resilient cities, e.g. using flood-prone areas for food and employment, and (ii) operationally trialling innovative institutional mechanisms, e.g. differential land taxes to support sustainable urban agriculture or payments for environmental services provided by urban agriculture such as carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus. The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. METHODS: A total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed. RESULTS: Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1{\%}, 82.7{\%} and 64.7{\%}, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately. The presence of antibodies was {\textless}40{\%} among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0{\%} (Ab), 94.3{\%} (IgM) and 79.8{\%} (IgG) since day-15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7{\%} (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5{\%} (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p{\textless}0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.},

This study also investigates the mechanical strength and piezoelectric characteristics of a single PVDF/MWCNT nanofiber. The morphology and polarization intensity of piezoelectric fiber can be controlled by adjusting the traveling velocity of the X-Y stage, the DC voltage, and the gap between the needle and collection plate. The optimal parameters of the PVDF solution, such as the PVDF powder weight percentage and MWCNT content, were also determined. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows a high diffraction peak at 2$\theta$ = 20.8° in the piezoelectric crystal $\beta$-phase structure. ANSYS finite element analysis (FEA) software with coupled field analysis was used to realize piezoelectric actuation behavior of the PVDF fibers. A nano-indentation test (NanoIndenter XP System, MTS co.) was used to investigate Young's modulus of the PVDF fiber. Finally, the fixed-fixed beam structures of PVDF composite fibers were tested using a DC voltage supply. Comparing the polarized fiber with non-polarized fibers, the measurement of the center displacements as a function of electric field was conducted and characterized. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {This chapter discusses thermodynamics and energy relations of seawater. Much of the physics of the liquid state can be elucidated through a better understanding of the molecular character of the main constituents of seawater—namely, H2O, Na+, Cl–, and Mg++. Other than these major constituents, seawater contains nearly all known natural elements, some of which are present in exceedingly minute amounts. However, it is the properties of pure water and the dissolved salts that account for the dominant characteristics of the medium. Water enters into important oceanic processes in all three of its phases—gaseous, liquid, and solid. The latent heat of vaporization and condensation are the major means by which the sea communicates with the atmosphere. The addition of salt to water alters its thermodynamic properties in various ways, some of which have important qualitative and quantitative effects. The addition of salt also increases the density and depresses both the temperature of maximum density and the freezing point temperature. The physical laws that underlie the coupled hydrodynamic and thermodynamic equations are Newton's equations, conservation laws for mass, salinity, and heat flow, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, an equation of state, and an equation for internal energy or enthalpy. {\textcopyright} 1988, Academic Press},

abstract = {Despite three decades of advances in information and communications technology (ICT) and a generation of research on cognition and new pedagogical strategies, the field of assessment has not progressed much beyond paper-and pencil item-based tests. Research has shown these instruments are not valid measures of sophisticated intellectual performances. Simply using technology to deliver automated versions of item-based tests does not realize the full power of ICT to innovate in assessment via providing rich experiences that enable observing and analyzing student performances. To illustrate this approach, we describe our early research on using immersive technologies to develop virtual performance assessments.

abstract = {Cities across the United States that have considerable vacant land are debating whether to foster community gardens on that land, while cities with land shortages are debating when to replace gardens with other uses. Meanwhile, many cities are looking for new ways to finance green spaces. Little empirical evidence about the neighborhood impacts of community gardens is available, however, to inform the debate or to help cities design financing schemes. This article estimates the impact of community gardens on neighborhood property values, using rich data for New York City and a difference-in-difference specification of a hedonic regression model. We find that gardens have significant positive effects, especially in the poorest neighborhoods. Higher-quality gardens have the greatest positive impact. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association.},

Sodium acetate trihydrate and ethanol each play role as photoactive compound (PAC) and solvent, respectively. Photoresist thin films were grown through spin coating method in voltage 5 V during the 60 s and heating temperature of 150 °C for 15 min. To determine photoresist sensitivity, ultraviolet and X-ray were exposed on the photoresist surfaces. The fabricated photoresist properties are densities of 1 g‧mL–1 to 1.23 g‧mL–1 , dynamic viscosities of 7 Cp to 22 Cp and kinematic viscosities of 7 Cst to 18 Cst. The absorbances of thin films are in the wavelength range of 350 nm to 1050 nm at the maximum absorbances of 0.2 to 0.5 in the wavelength g-line, h-line, and i-line.

The electronic transport properties of the resulting composites were investigated by means of impedance spectroscopy. It was found that a very low critical weight fraction (pc = 0.064 wt{\%}) which may be taken to correspond to the formation of a tunneling conductive network inside the matrix. The insulator-to-conductor transition region spanned about one order of magnitude from 0.1 to 1 wt{\%}. Far from the transition, the conductivity increased by two orders of magnitude. This increase and the low value of the conductivity were explained in terms of the presence of an epoxy film at the contact between CNF. A simple model based on the CNF-CNF contact network inside the matrix was proposed in order to evaluate the thickness of that film. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Although differences exist within and among groups, more minority elders live in more poverty and with lower incomes than their white counterparts.

Wastewater flowing into the river is channeled for irrigation in this drought-prone, semi-arid area with falling groundwater tables. Wastewater volumes have increased as more water is supplied to Hyderabad. Paddy farmers engaged in continuous innovation in agricultural and water management strategies in response to deteriorating irrigation water quality yet improved water availability.

abstract = {In this paper, SU-8 EPON-based photoresist (PR) polymerization optimization and its possible microfluidic and MEMS applications are reported. First, the optimization results of SU-8 under UV lithography are reported. The parameters which could have an influence on the lithography quality were chosen and optimized by a three-level, L9 orthogonal array of the Taguchi method. By optimization, the optimal parameter range and the weighted per cent of a parameter on the final results were determined. For SU-8-5 and SU-8-50, many microstructures with thicknesses of more than 100 and 500 µm and aspect ratios of more than 20 and 50 were obtained with high resolution. The optimization results show that the prebake time plays the key role in the quality, which is different from the previously published results. With the optimization results obtained, some possible applications of SU-8 were developed and demonstrated. These applications included using SU-8 as a structural material for a microfluidic system, as a micromold for electroplating, as a master for plastic hot-embossing, and even as a mask for some wet-etching processes.},

@book{Chemistry2009,
abstract = {The very rapid development of food chemistry and technology over the last two decades, which is due to a remarkable increase in the analytical and manufacturing possibilities, makes the complete lack of a comprehensive, teaching or reference text particularly noticeable. It is hoped that this textbook of food chemistry will help to fill this gap. In writing this volume we were able to draw on our experience from the lectures which we have given, covering various scientific subjects, over the past fifteen years at the Technical University of Munich. Since a separate treatment of the important food constituents (proteins, lipids, car- bohydrates, flavor compounds, etc.) and of the important food groups (milk, meat, eggs, cereals, fruits, vegetables, etc.) has proved successful in our lectures, the sub- ject matter is also organized in the same way in this book. Compounds which are found only in particular foods are discussed where they play a distinctive role while food additives and contaminants are treated in their own chapters. The physical and chemical properties of the important constituents of foods are discussed in detail where these form the basis for understanding ei- ther the reactions which occur, or can be expected to occur, during the production, processing, storage and handling of foods or the methods used in analyzing them. An attempt has also been made to clarify the relationship between the structure and properties at the level of individual food constituents and at the level of the whole food system. The book focuses on the chemistry of foodstuffs and does not consider national or international food regulations. We have also omitted a broader discussion of aspects related to the nutritional value, the processing and the toxicology of foods. All of these are an essential part of the training of a food chemist but, because of the extent of the subject matter and the consequent specialization, must today be the subject of separate books. Nevertheless, for all important foods we have included brief discussions of manufacturing processes and their parameters since these are closely related to the chemical reactions occurring in foods. Commodity and production data of importance to food chemists are mainly given in tabular form. Each chapter includes some references which are not intended to form an exhaustive list. No preference or judgement should be inferred from the choice of references; they are given simply to encourage further reading. Additional literature of a more general nature is given at the end of the book. This book is primarily aimed both at students of food and general chemistry but also at those students of other disciplines who are required or choose to study food chemistry as a supplementary subject. We also hope that this comprehensive text will prove useful to both food chemists and chemists who have completed their formal education.},

This has resulted in a wide variety of definitions and interpretations that are skewed towards institutional and group prerogatives rather than compounding the essence of the concept, which has been inherent in traditional beliefs and practices. A systematic analysis of representative definitions and interpretations presented in this article reveals that most of the contemporary definitions focus on specific elements while failing to capture the whole spectrum. Such a historical and conceptual analysis focusing on the analysis of the metaphorical and epistemological basis of the different definitions is believed to be the first step towards developing a concrete body of theory on sustainability and sustainable development.},

abstract = {Innovative forms of green urban architecture aim to combine food, production, and design to produce food on a larger scale in and on buildings in urban areas. It includes rooftop gardens, rooftop greenhouses, indoor farms, and other building-related forms (defined as “ZFarming”). This study uses the framework of sustainability to understand the role of ZFarming in future urban food production and to review the major benefits and limitations. The results are based on an analysis of 96 documents published in accessible international resources. The analysis shows that ZFarming has multiple functions and produces a range of non-food and non-market goods that may have positive impacts on the urban setting. It promises environmental benefits resulting from the saving and recycling of resources and reduced food miles. Social advantages include improving community food security, the provision of educational facilities, linking consumers to food production, and serving as a design inspiration. In economic terms it provides potential public benefits and commodity outputs. However, managing ZFarming faces several challenges. For some applications, the required technologies are known but have not been used or combined in that way before; others will need entirely new materials or cultivation techniques. Further critical aspects are the problem of high investment costs, exclusionary effects, and a lack of acceptance. In conclusion, ZFarming is seen as an outside-the-box solution which has some potential in generating win–win scenarios in cities. Nevertheless, ZFarming practices are not in and of themselves sustainable and need to be managed properly.},

abstract = {In the electrospinning process, polymer fibers with submicron-scale diameters are formed by subjecting a fluid jet to a high electric field. We report an experimental investigation of the electrically forced jet and its instabilities. The results are interpreted within the framework of a recently developed theory for electrified fluid jets. We find that the process can be described by a small set of operating parameters and summarized through the use of operating diagrams of electric field versus flow rate. In addition, the jet current is related to the net charge density and found to depend on the fluid properties, the applied electric field and the equipment configuration. The net charge density appears to be relatively insensitive to the flow rate, at least for high flow rates. The experiments reveal that a key process in the formation of submicron-scale solid fibers is a convective instability, the rapidly whipping jet. The dependence of this instability on electric field and flow rate, and the exponential nature of its growth rate are in accord with the theory.},

abstract = {We present a method for controlled deposition of oriented polymeric nanofibres. The method uses a microfabricated scanned tip as an electrospinning source. The tip is dipped in a polymer solution to gather a droplet as a source material. A voltage applied to the tip causes the formation of a Taylor cone, and at sufficiently high voltages, a polymer jet is extracted from the droplet. By moving the source relative to a surface, acting as a counter-electrode, oriented nanofibres can be deposited and integrated with microfabricated surface structures. For example, we deposited fibres of polyethylene oxide with diameters ranging from 100 to 1800 nm, with the diameter primarily depending on the concentration of the polymeric solution. In addition to the uniform fibre deposition, the scanning tip electrospinning source can produce self-assembled composite fibres of micro- and nanoparticles aligned in a polymeric fibre. We also deposited oriented conductive polymeric fibres of polyaniline and investigated the conductivity of these fibres as components for polymeric nanoelectronics.},

abstract = {Electrospinning is a popular method for creating random, non-woven fibrous templates for biomedical applications, and a subtype technique termed near-field electrospinning (NFES) was devised by reducing the air gap distance to millimeters. This decreased working distance paired with precise translational motion between the fiber source and collector allows for the direct writing of fibers. We demonstrate a near-field electrospinning device designed from a MakerFarm Prusa i3v three-dimensional (3D) printer to write polydioxanone (PDO) microfibers. PDO fiber diameters were characterized over the processing parameters: Air gap, polymer concentration, translational velocity, needle gauge, and applied voltage. Fiber crystallinity and individual fiber uniformity were evaluated for the polymer concentration and translational fiber deposition velocity. Fiber stacking was evaluated for the creation of 3D templates to guide the alignment of human gingival fibroblasts. The fiber diameters correlated positively with polymer concentration, applied voltage, and needle gauge; and inversely correlated with translational velocity and air gap distance. Individual fiber diameter variability decreases, and crystallinity increases with increasing translational fiber deposition velocity. These data resulted in the creation of tailored PDO 3D templates, which guided the alignment of primary human fibroblast cells. Together, these results suggest that NFES of PDO can be scaled to create precise geometries with tailored fiber diameters for biomedical applications.},

abstract = {The rapid development of miniaturized electronic devices has increased the demand for compact on-chip energy storage. Microscale supercapacitors have great potential to complement or replace batteries and electrolytic capacitors in a variety of applications. However, conventional micro-fabrication techniques have proven to be cumbersome in building cost-effective micro-devices, thus limiting their widespread application. Here we demonstrate a scalable fabrication of graphene micro-supercapacitors over large areas by direct laser writing on graphite oxide films using a standard LightScribe DVD burner. More than 100 micro-supercapacitors can be produced on a single disc in 30 min or less. The devices are built on flexible substrates for flexible electronics and on-chip uses that can be integrated with MEMS or CMOS in a single chip. Remarkably, miniaturizing the devices to the microscale results in enhanced charge-storage capacity and rate capability. These micro-supercapacitors demonstrate a power density of ∼200 W cm-3, which is among the highest values achieved for any supercapacitor. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {The genus Digramma (Cestoda: Pseudophyllidea) described by Cholodkovsky in 1915 differs from the genus Ligula only by the number of the reproductive organs per proglottis. However, the occurrence of transitional forms in Digramma raises much confusion concerning its generic validity. In the present study, cestodes previously designated as Digramma and Ligula were collected from lakes in the lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and also from Qinghai Lake on Qingzang plateau, China. The entire internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA) and 5' end of 28S rDNA were compared between the Digramma and Ligula specimens. The low level of nucleotide variation between the two genera may imply that cestodes in the genus Digramma are paraphyletic to the Ligula genus, and Digramma is a synonym of Ligula. However, whether previously identified Digramma cestodes represent different species in the genus Ligula requires further investigation.},

This argues the need for a better balance in the literature and in statistical teaching between techniques and problem solving strategies." Whether analyzing risk factors, adjusting for biases in observational studies, or developing predictive models, there are common problems that few regression texts address. For example, there are missing data in the majority of datasets one is likely to encounter (other than those used in textbooks!) but most regression texts do not include methods for dealing with such data effectively, and texts on missing data do not cover regression modeling.},

abstract = {Porous electrospun poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL) fibres were produced through a non-solvent induced phase separation mechanism, using binary solvent systems with different properties. The effect of the solvent properties on the size and surface morphology of electrospun PCL fibres was investigated. Chloroform (CF), dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and formic acid (FA) were used as good solvents in mixtures with a poor solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), in order to generate pores on the fibre surface. The production of porous, bead free fibres with an average diameter ranging from 1470 to 2270 nm was achieved using 12.5{\%} w/v PCL in CF/DMSO solution with good/poor solvent ratios varying from 75{\%} to 90{\%} v/v at the applied voltage of 15 kV, a spinning distance of 20 cm, and the feed flow rate of 1 ml/h. DCM and THF were proven to be less suitable good solvents for the process due to the formation of a solid skin on the jet surface, caused by the limited diffusivity of the polymer molecules from the jet surface to the liquid core and its subsequent collapse. FA was found to be unsuitable due to its similar evaporation rate to DMSO. The pore formation was favoured at high good/poor solvent ratios, whereas, the production of fibres with ribbon cross sections or fibres with beads was more pronounced at low good/poor solvent ratios. Data fitting was used for the development of a second order polynomial equation, correlating the produced fibre average diameter to the solution parameters (conductivity, surface tension, and viscosity), for the given polymer and solvent systems, under the specific experimental conditions used in this study. The ternary mixture compositions that lead to the formation of porous fibres were mapped on a ternary graph.},

abstract = {This textbook examines the extent to which moral values play a role as productive forces for the economy, and explores the effect of ethical and unethical Behavior on the economy. It shows how ethics improves productivity in the economy, and provides specific ethics tools for practical application for students and managers. Stemming from an overall interdisciplinary approach, and combining recent research results from sciences such as economics, business administration, Behavioral economics, philosophy, psychology and sociology, this textbook fills a gap in the literature on ethics in business. The book begins with the foundations of business ethics by defining business ethics, delineating its objectives, and discussing the importance of business ethics for business, the economy and society. Next, it presents the ethical evaluation approaches to enable the reader to evaluate economic Behavior ethically. It then explores 'man in business', and deals with such issues as Behavior, motivation, ethical orientation, and the presence or absence of a sense of justice. Following this is a discussion of the rules of the market and of questions such as: Does the market economy promote ethical Behavior or is there a conflict of goals between ethics and market economy? Do companies have a social responsibility? The book concludes with an analysis of the importance of ethics for productivity in the enterprise and in the economy, and presents ethics tools as the instruments with which management can promote ethical Behavior of their employees. Following a textbook structure, the book first derives knowledge from scientific studies that is relevant for students, and then summarizes the results. It explains ethical assessment approaches, and then gives an ethical assessment of economic Behavior using case studies. It uses roleplaying and games to explain the Behavior of people in relation to ethics.},

abstract = {The value of lymphography in the management of carcinoma of the cervix is controversial and in many institutions has ceased to be used as part of routine staging. We present the results of 103 patients with carcinoma of the cervix treated by radical radiotherapy alone at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 1984 and 1990 all of whom had a staging lymphogram and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis as part of their routine staging prior to therapy. Our results show that 72 patients (70{\%}) had no involved nodes detected on either CT or lymphography (LG-ve/CT-ve) while 16 patients (15.5{\%}) were thought to have involved lymph nodes on lymphography alone but not on CT (LG+ve/CT-ve). The remaining 15 cases (14.5{\%}) had involved lymph nodes on both CT and lymphography (LG+ve/CT+ve). There were no patients shown to have involved lymph nodes on CT with a negative lymphogram. Survival analysis on these three groups showed that patients in the LG+ve/CT+ve group did worse than the other two groups with only a 28{\%} 5 year survival compared with 60{\%} (LG-ve/CT-ve group) and 64{\%} (LG+ve/CT-ve group) (p {\textless} 0.1). This effect of lymph node involvement disappeared in a multivariate analysis using Cox regression when stage came out as the strongest factor affecting survival. After controlling for stage, a further analysis of patients with only stage I and II disease has shown that patients who were LG+ve/CT+ve still did significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) worse (30{\%} 5 year survival) than the other two groups: LG-ve/CT-ve (62{\%} 5 year survival) and LG+ve/CT-ve (78{\%} 5 year survival). The lymphogram result in the LG+ve/CT-ve group altered clinical management in 5/6 patients with stage I or IIA disease who avoided radical surgery and who were given a parametrial boost to the site of lymph node involvement. The possible benefit of this additional treatment to explain the higher survival rate of patients in the LG+ve/CT-ve group is discussed further. We conclude that lymphography still has a limited role to play in patients with early stage disease (I or IIA) who do not appear to have involved lymph nodes on CT scanning.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Electrospinning is a versatile and efficient fabrication method for one-dimensional (1D) nanostructured fibers of metals, metal oxides, hydrocarbons, composites, and so forth. The resulting nanofibers (NFs) with controllable diameters ranging from nanometer to micrometer scale possess unique properties such as a high surface-area-to-volume and aspect ratio, low density, and high pore volume. These properties make 1D nanomaterials more advantageous than conventional materials in energy harvesting, conversion, and storage devices. In this review, the key parameters for e-spinning are discussed and the properties of electrospun NFs and applications in solar cells, fuel cells, nanogenerators, hydrogen energy harvesting and storage, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of electrospinning and an outlook on the possible future directions are also discussed.},

This handbook consists of 25 chapters organized into four sections: basic concepts and theories, the Internet, special populations, and special topics. The authors of the 25 chapters are well-known, and many have published in Financial Counseling and Planning. Overall, readers will enjoy this book. Although the handbook was developed with educators, researchers, and policy makers in mind, financial practitioners will gain additional insight on their clients from these carefully written chapters. Educators will find ideas for the development of new programs and the evaluation of existing programs. Policymakers are likely to gain a better understanding of consumers and their financial attitudes and behavior. In summary, I believe that this handbook is a rich source of information on consumer finance research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {In this work, we present the investigation of the pyrolysis parameters at high temperature (1100 °C) for the fabrication of two-dimensional pyrolytic carbon electrodes. The electrodes were fabricated by pyrolysis of lithographically patterned negative epoxy based photoresist SU-8. A central composite experimental design was used to identify the influence of dwell time at the highest pyrolysis temperature and heating rate on electrical, electrochemical and structural properties of the pyrolytic carbon: Van der Pauw sheet resistance measurements, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the pyrolytic carbon. The results show that the temperature increase from 900 °C to 1100 °C improves the electrical and electrochemical properties. At 1100 °C, longer dwell time leads to lower resistivity, while the variation of the pyrolysis parameters has small influence on electrochemical performance.},

abstract = {Nowadays it is easy to imagine that the exploitation of different additive manufacturing approaches could find use in regenerative medicine and frontiers nanotechnology with a strong interest in the development of in vivo bio-incubators that better replicate the tissue environment. Various electrospinning technologies have been exploited for the fabrication of composite polymeric architectures, where fibers have been used for the construction layer by layer of micro-architectures. Unfortunately, in case of processing biomaterials, the intrinsic factors of the materials could become obstacles when considering such advanced engineering methods. Here, for the first time, we use the pyro-EHD process for the fabrication of layered three-dimensional architectures made using a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer. The proposed approach for layered 3D printing works at mild temperature allowing deposition at high resolution and great flexibility in manufacturing, avoiding high voltage generators, and nozzles. The layered 3D printing, activated by the pyro-electric effect, is discussed and characterized in terms of geometrical features and processing parameters. Different geometries and micro-architecture (wall, square, triangle, and hybrid structures) have been demonstrated and over printing of composite polymer, obtained by mixing multiwall carbon nanotubes and fluorochrome, has been discussed, focusing on the use of a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer.},

abstract = { Co-axial electrospraying and electrospinning are versatile electrohydrodynamic (EHD) techniques that can be used to encapsulate a variety of materials in the form of polymeric particles and fibres via a one step process.  Co-axial electrospraying and electrospinning are versatile electrohydrodynamic (EHD) techniques that can be used to encapsulate a variety of materials in the form of polymeric particles and fibres via a one step process. The successful production of uniform encapsulated products in co-axial EHD (CEHD) processing depends on multiple parameters including solution concentration, applied voltage and needle capillary diameter. Although many studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of these parameters, there has been very limited research on how the axial displacement between the two needle tips affects the final products formed. Hence the purpose of this study was to adjust the positioning of the inner needle such that its tip extends beyond, is level with or resides inside that of the outer needle and to thus determine the most effective arrangement for controlling product size, uniformity and/or yield. Core–shell particles were prepared using two polymers, poly(lactic- co -glycolic)acid (PLGA) as the shell and polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ) as the core and core–shell fibres using PMSQ as the shell and a volatile liquid, perfluorohexane (PFH) as the core. The products formed were analyzed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). After analysis, it was concluded that the most effective arrangement for generating both particles and fibres with the optimal combination of size, uniformity and yield was to have the inner needle 2 mm inside the outer needle. This allows for formation of a stable cone–jet and successful encapsulation of the inner liquid within the outer liquid, before the outer stable cone–jet forms. The corresponding collected product diameter and percentage of products in which material was successfully encapsulated were found to be 0.6 ± 0.1 $\mu$m and 85 ± 3{\%} respectively for particles and 9 ± 1 $\mu$m and 92 ± 2{\%} for fibres. },

abstract = {In this work, the dynamics of a transient network is analyzed with a model that includes two coupled kinetic processes to describe the rheological behavior of complex fluids. Five microstates are defined, representing the complexity of interactions among the macromolecules suspended in a Newtonian fluid. These microstates represent statistically networks with varying entanglement density, such as a dense entangled network in one extreme, and free chains or dangling ends (pendant chains) on the other extreme. It is assumed that the energy barrier required to modify the complexity of the system can be provided by flow, and that the flow-induced change in the network complexity is modelled as a coupled kinetic scheme constituted by a set of reversible kinetic equations describing the evolution of the microstates. The average concentration of microstates at a given time defines the maximum segment length joining the entanglement points in the transient network. The rheological material functions are calculated according to the classical statistical description of a transient network, but with a variable maximum segment length (variable extensibility), which is a function of the kinetics of the microstates. The model predicts shear banding in steady simple shear and time-dependent non-linear rheological phenomena, such as thixotropy, stretched exponential relaxation and other interesting responses of complex fluids. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Graphitic carbons' unique attributes have attracted worldwide interest towards their development and application. Carbon pyrolysis is a widespread method for synthesizing carbon materials. However, our understanding of the factors that cause differences in graphitization of various pyrolyzed carbon precursors is inadequate. We demonstrate how electro-mechanical aspects of the synthesis process influence molecular alignment in a polymer precursor to enhance its graphitization. Electrohydrodynamic forces are applied via electrospinning to unwind and orient the molecular chains of a non-graphitizing carbon precursor, polyacrylonitrile. Subsequently, exerting mechanical stresses further enhances the molecular alignment of the polymer chains during the formative crosslinking phase. The stabilized polymer precursor is then pyrolyzed at 1000 °C and characterized to evaluate its graphitization. The final carbon exhibits a uniformly graphitized structure, abundant in edge planes, which translates into its electrochemical kinetics. The results highlight the significance of physical synthesis conditions in defining the structure and properties of pyrolytic carbons.},

Readers with little prior exposure to physics will enjoy the book's conversational tone as they delve into such topics as the Hilbert space approach to quantum theory; the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation in one space dimension; the Spectral Theorem for bounded and unbounded self-adjoint operators; the Stone–von Neumann Theorem; the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation; the role of Lie groups and Lie algebras in quantum mechanics; and the path-integral approach to quantum mechanics. The numerous exercises at the end of each chapter make the book suitable for both graduate courses and independent study. Most of the text is accessible to graduate students in mathematics who have had a first course in real analysis, covering the basics of L2 spaces and Hilbert spaces. The final chapters introduce readers who are familiar with the theory of manifolds to more advanced topics, including geometric quantization.},

abstract = {Nanotubes assembled from macrocyclic precursors offer a unique combination of low dimensionality, structural rigidity, and distinct interior and exterior microenvironments. Usually the weak stacking energies of macrocycles limit the length or strength of the resultant nanotubes. Imine-linked macrocycles were recently found to assemble into high-aspect ratio ({\textgreater}10 3), lyotropic nanotubes in the presence of excess acid. Yet these harsh conditions are incompatible with many functional groups and processing methods, and lower acid loadings instead catalyze macrocycle degradation. Here we report pyridine-2,6-diimine-linked macrocycles that assemble into high-aspect ratio nanotubes in the presence of less than 1 equiv of CF3CO2H per macrocycle. Analysis by gel permeation chromatography and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed a cooperative self-assembly mechanism. Nanofibers obtained by touch-spinning the pyridinium-based nanotubes exhibit Young's mod-uli of 1.48 GPa, which exceeds that of many synthetic polymers and biological filaments. These findings will enable the design of structurally diverse nanotubes from synthetically accessible macrocycles.},

abstract = {Given the rapid advances in the field, this book offers an up-to-date introduction to nanomaterials and nanotechnology. Though condensed into a relatively small volume, it spans the whole range of multidisciplinary topics related to nanotechnology. Starting with the basic concepts of quantum mechanics and solid state physics, it presents both physical and chemical synthetic methods, as well as analytical techniques for studying nanostructures. The size-specific properties of nanomaterials, such as their thermal, mechanical, optical and magnetic characteristics, are discussed in detail. The book goes on to illustrate the various applications of nanomaterials in electronics, optoelectronics, cosmetics, energy, textiles and the medical field and discusses the environmental impact of these technologies. Many new areas, materials and effects are then introduced, including spintronics, soft lithography, metamaterials, the lotus effect, the Gecko effect and graphene. The book also explains the functional principles of essential techniques, such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning near field optical microscopy (SNOM), Raman spectroscopy and photoelectron microscopy. In closing, Chapter 14, ‘Practicals', provides a helpful guide to setting up and conducting inexpensive nanotechnology experiments in teaching laboratories.},

However, fabricating such complex materials in the laboratory remains challenging. Here we describe a method to continuously create microfibres with tunable morphological, structural and chemical features using a microfluidic system consisting of a digital, programmable flow control that mimics the silk-spinning process of spiders. With this method we fabricated hydrogel microfibres coded with varying chemical composition and topography along the fibre, including gas micro-bubbles as well as nanoporous spindle-knots and joints that enabled directional water collection. We also explored the potential use of the coded microfibres for tissue engineering applications by creating multifunctional microfibres with a spatially controlled co-culture of encapsulated cells.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In this work, the effects of process parameters on the deposition of single component and compound core-shell jets in near-field electrospinning are reported. It is shown that the working distance and fibre collector speed have a more significant influence on the deposition of a single jet than the flow rate. In the case of a compound jet, it is shown that jet deposition onto aluminium foil results in a linear fibre form, but on glass slides it appears as a random fibre network. The fabrication of aligned and patterned core-shell structured fibres is demonstrated by coaxial electrospinning of sugar and polycaprolactone (PCL) solutions. Aligned sugar-PCL core-shell fibres with diameters of ∼1.2 $\mu$m are deposited on an x-y translation stage, 10 cm below the coaxial spinneret. Complex patterns of sugar-PCL core-shell fibres with average diameters ranging from 72 to 175 $\mu$m are fabricated by reducing the working distance to 2 cm. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose, a dynamic second-law efficiency is introduced and assumed to be constant. As the first-law efficiency increases from zero up to the Carnot limit, the common final temperature of the reservoirs interpolates between the arithmetic and geometric mean of their initial temperatures. The total output work and entropy change of the reservoirs are computed and related to the static efficiencies. The dynamic and static efficiencies are shown to be approximately equal to each other when the temperature of the cold reservoir is at least 10{\%} of the temperature of the hot reservoir.},

abstract = {Adsorption by nanoporous media is critically involved in many fundamental geological and geochemical processes including chemical weathering, element migration and enrichment, environmental pollution, etc. Yet, the adsorption behavior of metal ions on nanoporous materials has not been systematically investigated. In this study, MCM-41 material with a monodisperse pore size (4.4 nm) and a large BET specific surface area (839 m2/g) was hydrothermally prepared and used as a model silica adsorbent to study the adsorption characteristics of Cu2+ as a representative metal ion. The Cu2+ adsorption capacity was found to increase with increasing suspension pH in the range from 3 to 5 and to decrease in the presence of NaNO3. At 25 °C, pH = 5, and a solid-to-liquid ratio of 5 g/L, the adsorption capacity was determined to be 0.29 mg/g, which can be converted to a dimensionless partition coefficient of 45, indicating a strong enriching effect of nanoporous silica. The adsorption isotherm and kinetic data were fitted to several commonly used thermodynamic, kinetic, and diffusion models. The adsorption mechanism was also studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The results suggest that Cu2+ ion adsorption is an entropy-driven endothermal process, possibly involving both outer-sphere and inner-sphere complexes.},

abstract = {Nanofibers of polymers were electrospun by creating an electrically charged jet of polymer solution at a pendent droplet. After the jet flowed away from the droplet in a nearly straight line, it bent into a complex path and other changes in shape occurred, during which electrical forces stretched and thinned it by very large ratios. After the solvent evaporated, birefringent nanofibers were left. In this article the reasons for the instability are analyzed and explained using a mathematical model. The rheological complexity of the polymer solution is included, which allows consideration of viscoelastic jets. It is shown that the longitudinal stress caused by the external electric field acting on the charge carried by the jet stabilized the straight jet for some distance. Then a lateral perturbation grew in response to the repulsive forces between adjacent elements of charge carried by the jet. The motion of segments of the jet grew rapidly into an electrically driven bending instability. The three-dimensional paths of continuous jets were calculated, both in the nearly straight region where the instability grew slowly and in the region where the bending dominated the path of the jet. The mathematical model provides a reasonable representation of the experimental data, particularly of the jet paths determined from high speed videographic observations. {\textcopyright} 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

@book{Zweifel2017,
abstract = {With interest in topics such as climate change, energy security, and alternative energy sources being at an all-time high, the effects of today's decisions now rest on the shoulders of future generations. There are no easy answers to our energy issues, so costs and benefits must be considered when evaluating all energy alternatives; alongside that, prices must be right and need to reflect the full social costs to society of a given source of energy. Energy Economics outlines the fundamental issues and possible solutions to the challenges of energy production and use, and presents a framework for energy decisions based upon sound economic analysis. It considers market forces and policy goals, including economic prosperity, environmental protection, and other considerations that affect societal well-being. This book focuses on both energy choices and the impact of these choices on market performance, environmental conditions, and sustainability. The initial section covers the fundamental economic concepts for analyzing energy markets. Following this, a detailed analysis of established energy sources, specifically fossil fuels and nuclear energy, leads into consideration of energy alternatives such as renewable energy and next-generation alternatives. Electricity production and regulatory trends are covered in depth. The final section considers policy: environmental considerations, sustainability, and energy security. The concluding chapter is a comprehensive vision for our energy future. Drawing on current energy headlines, perspectives familiar from the popular press, and views outside economics, this text sharpens students' ability to understand, evaluate, and critique policy using appropriate economic analysis. The text builds a foundation that culminates in a view of a comprehensive energy policy that improves upon the vacillations of past decades.},

abstract = {The new paradigm of sustainable development has not yet penetrated all of the business sciences. Although the concept has found its way into management studies in business administration programs, as well as into marketing and other subdisciplines, most economists have ignored the topic. Two contrasting positions are identifiable in the relatively few publications to date that deal with this subject: The position advocated in neoclassical economics stands in irreconcilable opposition to that of ``ecological'' economics. The proponents of both disciplines, however, initially start with the premise of intergenerational equity, which states that the lifestyles of current generations may not jeopardize the quality of life of future generations (WCED, Our common future, Oxford, 1987, p. 43).},

@article{QIU2013,
abstract = {The temperature difference between an urban space and surrounding non-urban space is called the urban heat island effect (UHI). Global terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) can consume 1.4803×1023 joules (J) of energy annually, which is about 21.74{\%} of the total available solar energy at the top of atmosphere, whereas annual human energy use is 4.935×1020 J, about 0.33{\%} of annual ET energy consumption. Vegetation ET has great potential to reduce urban and global temperatures. Our literature review suggests that vegetation and urban agricultural ET can reduce urban temperatures by 0.5 to 4.0°C. Green roofs (including urban agriculture) and water bodies have also been shown to be effective ways of reducing urban temperatures. The cooling effects on the ambient temperature and the roof surface temperature can be 0.24-4.0°C and 0.8-60.0°C, respectively. The temperature of a water body (including urban aquaculture) can be lower than the temperature of the surrounding built environment by between 2 and 6°C, and a water body with a 16 m2 surface area can cool up to 2 826 m3 of nearby space by 1°C. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the increase of evapotranspiration in cities, derived from vegetation, urban agriculture, and water body, can effectively mitigate the effect of urban heat islands.},

abstract = {In this study, a cylindrical near-field electrospinning (CNFES) process was used to fabricate poly($\gamma$-benzyl $\alpha$, l-glutamate) (PBLG) fibers with permanent piezoelectricity. To analyze the piezoelectricity of various PBLG fibers, PBLG weight percentage, rotating tangential speed, electric field, and fiber diameter were investigated. The average diameter of the electrospun PBLG fiber is in the range from 4.37 to 25 $\mu$m with the optimum parameters (PBLG concentration: 18 wt{\%}, tangential collection velocity: 942.4778 mm/s, and electric field: 6×10 6 V/m). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to characterize PBLG nonwoven fiber fabrics (NFFs) made by the CNFES process. The PBLG NFFs with high absorption peak at 1650 cm −1 corresponding to $\alpha$-helix piezoelectric structures were demonstrated. In the experiment, the electrical energy output of one single PBLG fiber was characterized. The maximum power output is 138.42 pW with a load resistance of 8 MΩ. However, one single polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fiber was also tested under the same condition and measurement. The power output is up to 265.81 pW with a load resistance of 6 MΩ. The results show that the power generation of the PVDF fibers exceeds that of PBLG fibers by 68{\%}.},

abstract = {The general availability of third generation synchrotron sources has ushered in a new era of high pressure research. The crystal structure of materials under compression can now be determined by X-ray diffraction using powder samples and, more recently, from multi-nano single crystal diffraction. Concurrently, these experimental advancements are accompanied by a rapid increase in computational capacity and capability, enabling the application of sophisticated quantum calculations to explore a variety of material properties. One of the early surprises is the finding that simple metallic elements do not conform to the general expectation of adopting 3D close-pack structures at high pressure. Instead, many novel open structures have been identified with no known analogues at ambient pressure. The occurrence of these structural types appears to be random with no rules governing their formation. The adoption of an open structure at high pressure suggested the presence of directional bonds. Therefore, a localized atomic hybrid orbital description of the chemical bonding may be appropriate. Here, the theoretical foundation and experimental evidence supporting this approach to the elucidation of the high pressure crystal structures of group I and II elements and polyhydrides are reviewed. It is desirable and advantageous to extend and apply established chemical principles to the study of the chemistry and chemical bonding of materials at high pressure.},

Another advantage of this approach is that students are brought closer to the way physics is actually discovered and applied, as they are introduced right from the start to a more exploratory way of understanding phenomena and of developing their physical concepts. While not a requirement, it is advantageous for the reader to have some prior knowledge of scientific programming with a scripting-type language. This edition of the book uses Python, and a chapter devoted to the basics of scientific programming with Python is included. A parallel edition using Matlab instead of Python is also available.

Here, we present a high-throughput centrifugal electrospinning (HTP-CES) system capable of producing a large number of highly-aligned nanofiber samples with high-yield and tunable diameters. The versatility of the design was revealed when bead-less nanofibers were produced from copolymer chitosan/polycaprolactone (C-PCL) solutions despite variations in polymer blend composition or spinneret needle gauge. Compared to conventional electrospinning techniques, fibers spun with the HTP-CES not only exhibited superior alignment, but also better diameter uniformity. Nanofiber alignment was quantified using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. In addition, a concave correlation between the needle diameter and resultant fiber diameter was identified. This system can be easily scaled up for industrial production of highly-aligned nanofibers with tunable diameters that can potentially meet the requirements for various engineering and biomedical applications.},

The ranges of synthesis temperature from 100 to 200 degrees were explored, and the ranges from 4.53 to 13.75 wt{\%} Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were investigated. The lengths and diameters of AgNWs from 15 to 30 $\mu$m and from 10 to 50 nm can be obtained, respectively. Then, the AgNWs embedded in PVP fibers (PVP/AgNWs) were fabricated by the near-field electrospinning (NFES) process. The AgNWs were broken down into nanoparticles when the applied electric field was over 1.4 × 107 V/m. However, the AgNWs could remain undamaged when the electric field was controlled between 8 × 106 and 1.2 × 107 V/m. Therefore, the threshold electric field can be determined and the diameter of the PVP/AgNWs fibers from 500 nm to 10 $\mu$m can be obtained. Next, the characteristics of the PVP/AgNWs were examined by N{\&}K analyzer, four-point probe, EDS and FTIR. The transmittance of PVP/AgNWs films was 51.29-68.97{\%} and the sheet resistance of purified AgNWs was 0.125 $\Omega$/sq which was superior to that of commercial ITO.

abstract = {Revolutionary developments in the fabrication of nanosized particles have created enormous expectations in the last few years for the use of such materials in areas such as medical diagnostics and drug-delivery, and in high-tech devices. By its very nature, nanotechnology is of immense academic and industrial interest as it involves the creation and exploitation of materials with structural features in between those of atoms and bulk materials, with at least one dimension limited to between 1 and 100 nm. Most importantly, the properties of materials with nanometric dimensions are, in most instances, significantly different from those of atoms or bulk materials. Research efforts geared towards new synthetic procedures for shape and size-uniform nanoscale building blocks as well as efficient self-assembly protocols for manipulation of these building blocks into functional materials has created enormous excitement in the field of liquid crystal research. Liquid crystals (LCs) by their very nature are suitable candidates for matrix-guided synthesis and self-assembly of nanoscale materials, since the liquid crystalline state combines order and mobility at the molecular (nanoscale) level. Based on selected relevant examples, this review attempts to give a short overview of current research efforts in LC-nanoscience. The areas addressed in this review include the synthesis of nanomaterials using LCs as templates, the design of LC nanomaterials, self-assembly of nanomaterials using LC phases, defect formation in LC-nanoparticle suspensions, and potential applications. Despite the seeming diversity of these research topics, this review will make an effort to establish logical links between these different research areas. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Throughout the 20th century, urban gardening in central and northern Europe as well as in North America has received a great deal of academic attention. However, the recent proliferation of urban gardening in other geographies, such as southern Europe in the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2007–2008, remains underexplored. The economic crisis put on hold urban developments in many southern European cities, leaving idle plots of land waiting to be urbanized. The crisis also triggered radical political demands, such as those of the Indignados, as well as fuelling narratives revolving around social entrepreneurship and social innovation. Barcelona emerges as a laboratory of urban gardening initiatives in vacant lots mobilizing either radical urban demands or embedding new post-crisis rhetoric around social entrepreneurship. Through a combination of qualitative methods, including participant observation, a literature review, semi-structured interviews, informal conversations and field diaries, we present a characterization and evolution of the three most prominent urban gardening initiatives in the city of Barcelona (including 54 gardens at the end of 2016): the Network of Municipal Gardens (municipally led gardens for retired people); the Network of Communitarian Gardens (social movements); and the Empty Plots Plan (social entrepreneurial urban gardening). Subsequently, we discuss the different meanings of gardening in crisis/post-crisis Barcelona as well as the urban politics that each initiative articulates.

@article{Zhang2015,
abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in people over age 65 in industrialized nations. Intravitreous injection of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) therapies, such as ranibizumab (trade name: Lucentis), provides an effective treatment option for neovascular AMD. We have developed an improved coaxial electrospray (CES) process to encapsulate ranibizumab in poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microparticles (MPs) for intravitreous injection and sustained drug release. This microencapsulation process is advantageous for maintaining the stability of the coaxial cone-jet configurations and producing drug-loaded MPs with as high as 70{\%} encapsulation rate and minimal loss of bioactivitiy. The utility of this emerging process in intravitreous drug delivery has been demonstrated in both benchtop and in vivo experiments. The benchtop test simulates ocular drug release using PLGA MPs encapsulating a model drug. The in vivo experiment evaluates the inflammation and retinal cell death after intravitreal injection of the MPs in a chick model. The experimental results show that the drug-load MPs are able to facilitate sustained drug release for longer than one month. No significant long term microglia reaction or cell death is observed after intravitreal injection of 200 $\mu$g MPs. The present study demonstrates the technical feasibility of using the improved CES process to encapsulate water-soluble drugs at a high concentration for sustained release of anti-VEGF therapy.},

abstract = {This textbook provides an overview for students in Criminology and Criminal Justice about the overlap between the criminal justice system and mental health. It provides an accessible overview of basic signs and symptoms of major mental illnesses and size of scope of justice-involved individuals with mental illness. In the United States, the criminal justice system is often the first public service to be in contact with individuals suffering from mental illness or in mental distress. Those with untreated mental illnesses are often at higher risk for committing criminal acts, yet research on this population continues to shed light on common myths - such a prevailing assumption that those with mental illness tend to commit more violent crimes. Law enforcement agents may be called in as first responders for cases of mental distress; and due to a lack of mental health facilities, resources, and pervasive misconceptions about this population, those with mental illness often end up in the corrections system. In this environment, students in Criminology and Criminal Justice are likely to encounter those with mental illness in their future career paths, and need to be prepared for this reality. This timely work covers the roles of each part of the criminal justice system interacting with mentally ill individuals, from law enforcement and first responders, social services, public health services, sentencing and corrections, to release and re-entry. It also covers the crucial topic of mental health for criminal justice professionals, who suffer from high rates of job stress, PTSD, and other mental health issues. The final section of the book includes suggestions for future research. This work will be of interest to students of criminology and criminal justice with an interest in working in the professional sector, as well as those in related fields of sociology, psychology, and public health. It will also be of interest to policy-makers and practitioners already working in the field. The overall goal of this work is to inform, educate, and inspire change.},

The increasing curcumin content did not influence the morphologies of melt electrospun fibre, but enhanced the range of diameter distribution of solution electrospun fibre owing to the curcumin aggregates in the spinning solution which disturbed the stability of jet. Moreover, a large amount of curcumin with amorphous state could be loaded in the melt electrospun fibre. Whereas the limited solubility of curcumin in the solvent led to the drug aggregates dispersing within the solution electrospun fibre. In addition, the melt electrospun fibres had low drug release rate without burst release on the profiles due to the high crystallinity in the fibre, but high drug release rate and burst release occurred on the release profiles of the solution electrospun fibres because of their low crystallinity, porous structure and roughness surface.},

abstract = {Provides a physics-centered analysis of a broad range of astronomical systems that appeals to a large audience of advanced undergraduate students in physics and engineering Illustrates estimation techniques that professional physicists and astronomers use in their research Emerges from lecture notes that have been used for nine years by three professors, all of whom have received Outstanding Teacher Awards from the Rutgers Society of Physics Students while teaching the course This book gives a survey of astrophysics at the advanced undergraduate level. It originates from a two-semester course sequence at Rutgers University that is meant to appeal not only to astrophysics students but also more broadly to physics and engineering students. The organization is driven more by physics than by astronomy; in other words, topics are first developed in physics and then applied to astronomical systems that can be investigated, rather than the other way around. The first half of the book focuses on gravity. Gravity is the dominant force in many astronomical systems, so a tremendous amount can be learned by studying gravity, motion and mass. The theme in this part of the book, as well as throughout astrophysics, is using motion to investigate mass. The goal of Chapters 2-11 is to develop a progressively richer understanding of gravity as it applies to objects ranging from planets and moons to galaxies and the universe as a whole. The second half uses other aspects of physics to address one of the big questions. While “Why are we here?” lies beyond the realm of physics, a closely related question is within our reach: “How did we get here?” The goal of Chapters 12-21 is to understand the physics behind the remarkable story of how the Universe, Earth and life were formed. This book assumes familiarity with vector calculus and introductory physics (mechanics, electromagnetism, gas physics and atomic physics); however, all of the physics topics are reviewed as they come up (and vital aspects of vector calculus are reviewed in the Appendix).},

The author begins with an introduction to the mechanical properties of materials, general fracture mechanics and the fracture of brittle solids. This is followed by a detailed description of indentation stress fields for both elastic and elastic-plastic contact. The discussion then turns to the formation of Hertzian cone cracks in brittle materials, subsurface damage in ductile materials, and the meaning of hardness.

However, these two techniques are not equally well suited for all resistance measurement applications. This article offers a quick overview of how to determine the most appropriate technique for a specific application. DMMs typically employ the constant-current method to measure resistance, which sources a constant current (I SOUR) to the device under test (DUT) and measures the voltage (V MEAS). Resistance (R DUT) is then calculated and displayed using the known current and measured voltage (R DUT = V MEAS /I SOUR). Figure 1 shows a simple diagram of the constant-current test.},

It is written from an engineering perspective, with special emphasis on circuit functionality and applications. Reliance on higher-level mathematics and physics, or theoretical proofs has been intentionally limited in order to prioritize the practical aspects of electrical engineering. This text is therefore suitable for a number of introductory circuit courses for other majors such as mechanical, biomedical, aerospace, civil, architecture, petroleum, and industrial engineering. The authors' primary goal is to teach the aspiring engineering student all fundamental tools needed to understand, analyze and design a wide range of practical circuits and systems. Their secondary goal is to provide a comprehensive reference, for both major and non-major students as well as practicing engineers.},

@article{Battaglini2019,
abstract = {The aim of this work was to use X-ray diffraction to identify substances used for adulteration of raw milk and to determine if crystallographic analysis can detect extraneous substances in milk. Two unknown substances were sent anonymously by employers linked to the dairy chain, who claimed that they were added directly in milk prior to water addition by truck drivers. The samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and submitted to physicochemical analysis. The first substance was identified by X-ray diffraction as sodium citrate, complying with its physicochemical attributes, such as the powerful ability to decrease the freezing point. The second substance was identified by X-ray diffraction as sucrose and this result was also in agreement with its ability to increase the density, decrease the freezing point and finally, to be positive for sucrose in the resorcinol qualitative test. To evaluate if X-ray diffraction can detect extraneous substances already mixed in milk, fresh raw milk samples tampered with urea, sodium hydroxide, sodium citrate and sucrose were freeze dried and analyzed by X-ray diffraction, with no detection of any extraneous substances at any percentage. This is the first report of attempted diagnosis of extraneous substances in milk by X-ray diffraction. However, this technique can be useful only when applied to identify substances used for adulteration prior to its dilution in milk, since the amorphous nature of milk seems to be a limitation for the accurate detection of extraneous substances.},

@article{Padgham2015,
abstract = {Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) is increasingly being promoted as a multi-focal strategy for enhancing urban food security and advancing climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts in cities. The extent to which this potential can be realized is circumscribed by access to adequate land and water resources, the degree of recognition of UPA within the urban policy domain, and the ability of producers to effectively navigate the myriad risks associated with food production in urban and peri-urban environments. This paper argues that UPA faces significant interlocking stresses stemming from marginalization of land and water resources, increasing exposure to climate risks, and ineffective policies and poor governance that undermine its long-term potential to address urban food security and climate change adaptation concerns. This paper examines key environmental and governance dimensions of UPA in the context of rapidly growing cities in Africa and Asia, and advances understanding of how increasing urban pressures on land and water resources, and intensifying climate risks, are undermining the resilience of UPA in the face of rapid change. The paper's findings are drawn from a series of assessments on UPA that were recently conducted in nine cities spanning West and East Africa, and South Asia.},

abstract = {Novel poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) membranes with regular geometric pore structure were fabricated via near-field electrospinning (NFES) method. Firstly, computer aided design (CAD) was utilized to design membrane's pore geometry (triangle, diamond, square, hexagon and their different size). Secondly, the PTFE spinning solution consisted of PTFE emulsion and carrier (PVA aqueous solution) was electrospun into nascent PTFE/PVA membrane, which had regular geometric pore structure. Finally, the nascent membrane suffered sintering process, and the NFES PTFE membrane was obtained. Effects of PTFE/PVA mass ratio, sintering temperature and annealing condition, pore geometry on the membrane morphology, structure and properties were investigated, respectively. Results found that the square membrane showed good combination of membrane performances and properties, when PTFE/PVA mass ratio was 6:1 and sintered at 380 °C followed by cooling in muffle furnace. Owing to the excellent hydrophobicity, the obtained PTFE membranes exhibited excellent oil/water separation performance in terms of high oil flux (707 L m-2 h-1) without extra pressure, and high separation efficiency (rejection up to 99.6{\%}). Owing to the regular and accurate pore structure, the PTFE membrane was utilized in the particle sequential separation. The mixed silica (SiO2) particles with a series of diameter (1, 5, 10, 20 $\mu$m) were sequential separated by PTFE membranes with different pore geometry, and the rejection reached up to 82.0{\%}.},

abstract = {One-dimensional piezoelectric nanomaterials have attracted great attention in recent years for their possible applications in mechanical energy scavenging devices. However, it is difficult to control the structural diameter, length, and density of these fibers fabricated by micro/nano-technologies. This work presents a hollow cylindrical near-field electrospinning (HCNFES) process to address production and performance issues encountered previously in either far-field electrospinning (FFES) or near-field electrospinning (NFES) processes. Oriented polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibers in the form of nonwoven fabric have been directly written on a glass tube for aligned piezoelectricity. Under a high in situ electrical poling field and strong mechanical stretching (the tangential speed on the glass tube collector is about 1989.3 mm s −1), the HCNFES process is able to uniformly deposit large arrays of PVDF fibers with good concentrations of piezoelectric $\beta$-phase. The nonwoven fiber fabric (NFF) is transferred onto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate and fixed at both ends using copper foil electrodes as a flexible textile-fiber-based PVDF energy harvester. Repeated stretching and releasing of PVDF NFF with a strain of 0.05{\%} at 7 Hz produces a maximum peak voltage and current at 76 mV and 39 nA, respectively.},

abstract = {Electrohydrodynamic direct-writing (EDW) is a developing technology for high-resolution printing. How to decrease the line width and improve the deposition accuracy of direct-written patterns has been the key to the promotion for the further application of EDW. In this paper, an airflow-assisted spinneret for electrohydrodynamic direct-writing was designed. An assisted laminar airflow was introduced to the EDW process, which provided an additional stretching and constraining force on the jet to reduce the surrounding interferences and enhance jet stability. The flow field and the electric field around the spinneret were simulated to direct the structure design of the airflow-assisted spinneret. Then, a series of experiments were conducted, and the results verified the spinneret design and demonstrated a stable ejection of jet in the EDW process. With assisted airflow, the uniformity of printed patterns and the deposition position accuracy of a charged jet can be improved. Complex patterns with positioning errors of less than 5{\%} have been printed and characterized, which provide an effective way to promote the integration of micro/nanosystems.},

@book{Braun1993,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus. The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. METHODS: A total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed. RESULTS: Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1{\%}, 82.7{\%} and 64.7{\%}, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately. The presence of antibodies was {\textless}40{\%} among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0{\%} (Ab), 94.3{\%} (IgM) and 79.8{\%} (IgG) since day-15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7{\%} (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5{\%} (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p{\textless}0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006).

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Carbon's electrochemistry depends on its type and microstructure, and how these affect the electrode's electronic density of states. We demonstrate how pyrolysis of electro-mechanically stressed Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers, infused with carbon nanotubes, will result in a unique graphitic electrode, which possesses enhanced and multifaceted electrochemical behavior. As corroborated by materials characterization, the microstructure of the stress-activated pyrolytic carbon (SAPC) characteristically contains a high proportion of disorders in the forms of edge planes and embedded heterogeneous nitrogen atoms. These disorders introduce a range of energy states near the Fermi level, yielding enhanced kinetics in the as-synthesized SAPC electrodes. A comprehensive electrochemical study of the SAPC electrode in surface sensitive ([Fe(CN)6]3-/4-), surface insensitive ([IrCl6]2-/3-), and adsorption sensitive (dopamine) redox probes demonstrates 5–14-fold increases in its heterogeneous electron transfer rate compared to regular PAN-based carbon electrodes. The fast kinetics of SAPC electrodes in adsorption sensitive analytes translates into its capability for simultaneous detection of dopamine, uric acid, and ascorbic acid. The results point to a new class of pyrolytic carbon electrodes with an attractive electrocatalytic capacity, geared toward electrochemical sensing platforms.},

abstract = {The wide adoption of path-tracing algorithms in high-end realistic rendering has stimulated many diverse research initiatives. In this paper we present a coherent survey of methods that utilize Monte Carlo integration for estimating light transport in scenes containing participating media. Our work complements the volume-rendering state-of-the-art report by Cerezo et al. [CPP*05]; we review publications accumulated since its publication over a decade ago, and include earlier methods that are key for building light transport paths in a stochastic manner. We begin by describing analog and non-analog procedures for freepath sampling and discuss various expected-value, collision, and track-length estimators for computing transmittance. We then review the various rendering algorithms that employ these as building blocks for path sampling. Special attention is devoted to null-collision methods that utilize fictitious matter to handle spatially varying densities; we import two “next-flight” estimators originally developed in nuclear sciences. Whenever possible, we draw connections between image-synthesis techniques and methods from particle physics and neutron transport to provide the reader with a broader context.},

abstract = {Electrospinning uses an external electrostatic field to accelerate and stretch a charged polymer jet, and may produce ultrafine “nanofibers.” Many polymers have been successfully electrospun in the laboratory. Recently Hohman et al. [Phys. Fluids, 13, 2201 (2001)] proposed an electrohydrodynamic model for electrospinning Newtonian jets. A problem arises, however, with the boundary condition at the nozzle. Unless the initial surface charge density is zero or very small, the jet bulges out upon exiting the nozzle in a “ballooning instability,” which never occurs in reality. In this paper, we will first describe a slightly different Newtonian model that avoids the instability. Well-behaved solutions are produced that are insensitive to the initial charge density, except inside a tiny “boundary layer” at the nozzle. Then a non-Newtonian viscosity function is introduced into the model and the effects of extension thinning and thickening are explored. Results show two distinct regimes of stretching.

abstract = {With the emergence of nanotechnology, researchers become more interested in studying the unique properties of nanoscale materials. Electrospinning, an electrostatic fiber fabrication technique has evinced more interest and attention in recent years due to its versatility and potential for applications in diverse fields. The notable applications include in tissue engineering, biosensors, filtration, wound dressings, drug delivery, and enzyme immobilization. The nanoscale fibers are generated by the application of strong electric field on polymer solution or melt. The non-wovens nanofibrous mats produced by this technique mimics extracellular matrix components much closely as compared to the conventional techniques. The sub-micron range spun fibers produced by this process, offer various advantages like high surface area to volume ratio, tunable porosity and the ability to manipulate nanofiber composition in order to get desired properties and function. Over the years, more than 200 polymers have been electropun for various applications and the number is still increasing gradually with time. With these in perspectives, we aim to present in this review, an overview of the electrospinning technique with its promising advantages and potential applications. We have discussed the electrospinning theory, spinnable polymers, parameters (solution and processing), which significantly affect the fiber morphology, solvent properties and melt electrospinning (alternative to solution electrospinning). Finally, we have focused on varied applications of electrospun fibers in different fields and concluded with the future prospects of this efficient technology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Over the past decade, Big Data have become ubiquitous in all economic sectors, scientific disciplines, and human activities. They have led to striking technological advances, affecting all human experiences. Our ability to manage, understand, interrogate, and interpret such extremely large, multisource, heterogeneous, incomplete, multiscale, and incongruent data has not kept pace with the rapid increase of the volume, complexity and proliferation of the deluge of digital information. There are three reasons for this shortfall. First, the volume of data is increasing much faster than the corresponding rise of our computational processing power (Kryder's law {\textgreater} Moore's law). Second, traditional discipline-bounds inhibit expeditious progress. Third, our education and training activities have fallen behind the accelerated trend of scientific, information, and communication advances. There are very few rigorous instructional resources, interactive learning materials, and dynamic training environments that support active data science learning. The textbook balances the mathematical foundations with dexterous demonstrations and examples of data, tools, modules and workflows that serve as pillars for the urgently needed bridge to close that supply and demand predictive analytic skills gap. Exposing the enormous opportunities presented by the tsunami of Big data, this textbook aims to identify specific knowledge gaps, educational barriers, and workforce readiness deficiencies. Specifically, it focuses on the development of a transdisciplinary curriculum integrating modern computational methods, advanced data science techniques, innovative biomedical applications, and impactful health analytics. The content of this graduate-level textbook fills a substantial gap in integrating modern engineering concepts, computational algorithms, mathematical optimization, statistical computing and biomedical inference. Big data analytic techniques and predictive scientific methods demand broad transdisciplinary knowledge, appeal to an extremely wide spectrum of readers/learners, and provide incredible opportunities for engagement throughout the academy, industry, regulatory and funding agencies.},

abstract = {In combination with tapered-trench-etching of Si and SU-8 photoresist, a grayscale mask for deep X-ray lithography was fabricated and passed a 10-times-exposure test. The performance of the X-ray grayscale mask was evaluated using the TERAS synchrotron radiation facility at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). Although the SU-8 before photo-curing has been evaluated as a negative-tone photoresist for ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray lithographies, the characteristic of the SU-8 after photo-curing has not been investigated. A polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sheet was irradiated by a synchrotron radiation through an X-ray mask, and relationships between the dose energy and exposure depth, and between the dose energy and dimensional transition, were investigated. Using such a technique, the shape of a 26-mu m-high Si absorber was transformed into the shape of a PMMA microneedle with a height of 76 mu m, and done with a high contrast. Although during the fabrication process of the X-ray mask a 100-mu m-pattern-pitch (by design) was enlarged to 120 mu m. However, with an increase in an integrated dose energy this number decreased to 99 mu m. These results show that the X-ray grayscale mask has many practical applications. In this paper, the author reports on the evaluation results of SU-8 when used as a membrane material for an X-ray mask.},

Mitigation and suppression of new infections have emerged as the two predominant public health control strategies5. Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term. We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests6,7 to identify and deploy recovered individuals8 as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission. Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well-recognized roles in estimating prevalence10,11 and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies12-15.},

@article{Husain2016,
abstract = {Electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) is a key research area for producing micro and nano-sized structures. This process can be categorized into two main operating regimes: electrospraying for particle generation and electrospinning for fibre production. Producing particles/fibres of the desired size or morphology depends on two main factors; properties of the polymeric solution used and the processing conditions including flow rate, applied voltage and collection distance. In this work the particle-fibre transition region was analyzed by changing the polymer concentration of PLGA poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) in acetone between 2 and 25 wt{\%}. Subsequently the processing conditions were adjusted to study the optimum transition parameters. Additionally the EHDA configuration was also modified by adding a metallic plate to observe the deposition area. The diameter and the distance of the plate from the capillary tip were adjusted to investigate variations in particle and fibre morphologies as well. It was found that complete transition from particles to fibres occurs at 20 wt{\%} indicating concentration to be the dominant criterion. Low flow rates yielded fibres without beads. However the applied voltage and distance between the tip of the nozzle jetting the polymer solution and collector (working distance) did not yield definitive results. Reducing the collector distance and increasing applied voltages produces smooth as well as beaded fibres. Addition of a metal plate reduces particle size by ∼ 1 $\mu$m; the fibre size increases especially with increasing plate diameter while bead density and size reduces when the disc is fixed closer to the capillary tip. Additionally, the deposition area is reduced by 70{\%} and 57{\%} with the addition of metal plates of 30 mm and 60 mm, respectively. The results indicate that a metal plate can be utilized further to tune the particle/fibre size and morphology and this also significantly increases the yield of EHDA process which is currently a limitation in adopting it as a mass production technique.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effect of laser fluence on a negative tone thin film resist, SU-8, using an all-fibre 405 nm laser direct writing technique. 405 nm Gaussian beam is delivered on the spin-coated SU-8 thin film using single mode fibre, followed by subsequent chemical developing process. Disc structure is formed where its dimension is affected by the laser fluence. We found that polymer processing using this technique can be categorized into three stages. In the first stage (fluence {\textgreater} 90 J/cm2), lens shaped structure is formed with linear increase in diameter with logarithmic increase in laser fluence. In second stage (fluence {\textgreater} 600 J/cm2), flat-top disc structure is formed and the increase in disc diameter slows down with increasing laser fluence. In the third stage (fluence {\textgreater} 49 kJ/cm2), crater is formed at the centre of the disc due to laser ablation. Moreover, relatively large exposure fluence above the value required for complete polymerization has allowed collateral thermal-polymerization of the surrounding of the disc structure and reduced aspect ratio of the structure. Hence, by controlling laser writing fluence, different structures mentioned above can be produced. This understanding serves as a basis for polymer patterning using the proposed all-fibre laser direct writing technique, which finds potential application in micro-lens array, polymer optical waveguide, photomask and Lab-On-Chip fabrication.},

abstract = {Being a highly promising material, graphene has triggered a great attention within researchers as-well-as has obtained some achievements in specific application areas. However, applying graphene to electronic devices via a facile method has proven to be difficult. Here, we have fabricated graphene by reducing graphene oxide (GO) under a 395 nm ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in a suspension containing Bis(cyclopentadienyl)bis[2,6-difluoro-3-(1-pyrryl)phenyl]titanium (GR-FMT) and GO. GR-FMT is an efficient free-radical type of photoinitiator, which is commonly used in photoresists. GO quickly reduces to graphene by accepting electrons generated by the decomposition of the GR-FMT photoinitiator under UV irradiation. Here, the GR-FMT plays both reductant and deoxidant roles and highly improves the reducing reaction efficiency. Photo etching is a commonly used technique in electronic device technology; however, its application to the mass production of GO, to be used in practical nano-devices and integrated circuits, is still an unresolved problem. To address this problem, in this work, graphene oxide is suspended in ethanol and it undergoes reduction by the UV-irradiated GR-FMT suspension; the corresponding mechanism is explored. This methodology turns out to be a novel and facile UV-assisted reduction technique with the advantage of being time-efficient and energy-efficient, simple, scalable, and environmental friendly.},

abstract = {Number of complex fluids (as slurries, drilling muds, paints and coatings, many foods, cosmetics. biofluids...) can approximately be described as concentrated dispersions of Structural Units (SUs). Due to shear forces, SUs are assumed to be approximately spherical in shape and uniform in size under steady flow conditions. so that a complex fluid can be considered as a roughly monodisperse dispersion of roughly spherical SUs (with a shear-dependent mean radius), what allows to generalize hard sphere models of monodisperse suspensions to complex fluids. A rheological model of such dispersions of SUs is based on the concept of the effective volume fraction. $\phi$effwhich depends on flow conditions. Indeed, in competition with particle interactions. hydrodynamic forces can modify (i) S. the number fraction of particles that all SUs contain. (ii) both SUs arrangements and their internal structure, especially the SU's compactness, $\phi$. As a structural variable, S is governed by a kinetic equation. Through the shear-dependent kinetic rates involved in the latter, the general solution S depends on $\Gamma$, a dimensionless shear variable. leading to $\phi$eff(t. $\Gamma$: $\phi$). The structural modelling is achieved by introducing this expression of $\phi$effinto a well-established viscosity model of hard sphere suspensions. Using the steady state solution of the kinetic equation. Seq($\Gamma$), allows to model non-Newtonian behaviors of complex fluids under steady shear conditions, as pseudo-plastic, plastic, dilatant ... ones. In this model. the ratio of high shear to low shear limiting viscosities appears as a key variable. Different examples of application will be discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper, hybrid Silicon-Barium Titanate (Si-BTO) based Two Dimensional Photonic Crystal (2DPC) platform is proposed for electric field sensing based on the effective refractive index modulation of electro-optic material. The nano-sensing platform is composed of the PC based resonator and inline quasi-waveguides in a 2D triangular lattice with circular rods that are arranged in the air medium. The BTO based nano-cavity resonator is playing a very important role in sensing the different electric field over a wide wavelength range. The operating wavelength range of the proposed sensor is investigated via Photonic Band Gap (PBG) which is obtained by the Plane Wave Expansion (PWE) method. The transmission efficiency, quality factor, electric field sensitivity and change in refractive index are analyzed by using Finite Difference Time Domain method (FDTD). The simulation results reveal that the resonant wavelength of the electric field sensor is linearly shifted to the higher wavelength region while increasing the electric field from 0 kV/mm to 25 kV/mm. The proposed sensing platform provides high transmission efficiency and very high refractive index sensitivity with an ultra-compact size. Hence, it is highly suitable for nano-chip based sensing applications.},

abstract = {Computing comprises three distinct strands: hardware, software and the ways they are used in real or imagined worlds. Its use in research is more than writing or running code. Having something significant to compute and deploying judgement in what is attempted and achieved are especially challenging. In science or engineering, one must define a central problem in computable form, run such software as is appropriate and, last but by no means least, convince others that the results are both valid and useful. These several strands are highly interdependent. A major scientific development can transform disparate aspects of information and computer technologies. Computers affect the way we do science, as well as changing our personal worlds. Access to information is being transformed, with consequences beyond research or even science. Creativity in research is usually considered uniquely human, with inspiration a central factor. Scientific and technological needs are major forces in innovation, and these include hardware and software opportunities. One can try to define the scientific needs for established technologies (atomic energy, the early semiconductor industry), for rapidly developing technologies (advanced materials, microelectronics) and for emerging technologies (nanotechnology, novel information technologies). Did these needs define new computing, or was science diverted into applications of then-available codes? Regarding credibility, why is it that engineers accept computer realizations when designing engineered structures, whereas predictive modelling of materials has yet to achieve industrial confidence outside very special cases? The tensions between computing and traditional science are complex, unpredictable and potentially powerful.},

abstract = {Due to the unique properties such as 3-dimensional nanoporous structure and high surface area, silica aerogel is a promising candidate for replacing the conventional micron-sized silica to improve the mechanical properties of epoxy-based nanocomposites. In the present study, the water-glass based silica aerogel was first synthesized by the low-cost sodium silicate and cheap ambient pressure drying method and then used as the filler in the epoxy system. Finally, rheological and mechanical properties of the silica aerogel-epoxy nanocomposite were investigated. The introduction of silica aerogel powders impacted the rheological properties of epoxy dispersion and improved the mechanical performance of the corresponding nanocomposite. The dispersion microstructure has been characterized by its rheological properties and has been used to determine the critical silica aerogel weight fraction of the network formation ($\phi$*) for the silica aerogel-epoxy dispersion. At the critical filler concentrations ($\phi$*), the overall mobility of the polymer chains is restricted in both dispersion and solid nanocomposites. Therefore, the network structure and the interface surrounding nanoparticles increases and this results in an improvement of the mechanical properties. Mechanical tests showed improvements in flexural modulus and strength by {\~{}} 80{\%} and {\~{}} 40{\%} respectively as compared with those of pure epoxy. Based on this study, water-glass based silica aerogel hold great promise as a low-cost filler in polymer composite.},

abstract = {[Plates 3 and 41 An investigation of the structure of carbons of different origin treated at temperatures between 1000 and 3000" C has shown that the graphitizing and non-graphitizing carbons form two distinct and well-defined classes. The differences in structure are apparent from the earliest stages of carbonization, and may be attributed mainly to the formation at low temperatures , in the non-graphitizing carbons, of a strong system of cross-linking uniting the crystallites. This leads to a random orientation of the crystallites in a rigid, finely porous mass. In the graphitizing carbons the cross-linking is much weaker, the structure is more compact, and neighbouring crystallites have a strong tendency to lie in nearly parallel orienta-t,ion. It is shown that crystallite growth occum by the gradual displaoement of whole layer-planes or even of groups of layer-planes. The pre-orientation existing in the graphitizing carbons facilitates this process, enabling the rearrangement of the layer-planes to take place by small stages. It is the principal factor favouring crystallite growth in the graphitizing carbons. In the non-graphitizing carbons crystallite growth is impeded both by the strong cross-linking between neighbouring crystallites and by their random orientation.},

abstract = {Summary We describe a process for capturing CO2 from the atmosphere in an industrial plant. The design captures ∼1 Mt-CO2/year in a continuous process using an aqueous KOH sorbent coupled to a calcium caustic recovery loop. We describe the design rationale, summarize performance of the major unit operations, and provide a capital cost breakdown developed with an independent consulting engineering firm. We report results from a pilot plant that provides data on performance of the major unit operations. We summarize the energy and material balance computed using an Aspen process simulation. When CO2 is delivered at 15 MPa, the design requires either 8.81 GJ of natural gas, or 5.25 GJ of gas and 366 kWhr of electricity, per ton of CO2 captured. Depending on financial assumptions, energy costs, and the specific choice of inputs and outputs, the levelized cost per ton CO2 captured from the atmosphere ranges from 94 to 232 {\$}/t-CO2.},

abstract = {The land, water, and energy requirements of hydroponics were compared to those of conventional agriculture by example of lettuce production in Yuma, Arizona, USA. Data were obtained from crop budgets and governmental agricultural statistics, and contrasted with theoretical data for hydroponic lettuce production derived by using engineering equations populated with literature values. Yields of lettuce per greenhouse unit (815 m2) of 41 ± 6.1 kg/m2/y had water and energy demands of 20 ± 3.8 L/kg/y and 90,000 ± 11,000 kJ/kg/y (±standard deviation), respectively. In comparison, conventional production yielded 3.9 ± 0.21 kg/m2/y of produce, with water and energy demands of 250 ± 25 L/kg/y and 1100 ± 75 kJ/kg/y, respectively. Hydroponics offered 11 ± 1.7 times higher yields but required 82 ± 11 times more energy compared to conventionally produced lettuce. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first quantitative comparison of conventional and hydroponic produce production by example of lettuce grown in the southwestern United States. It identified energy availability as a major factor in assessing the sustainability of hydroponics, and it points to water-scarce settings offering an abundance of renewable energy (e.g., from solar, geothermal, or wind power) as particularly attractive regions for hydroponic agriculture.},

abstract = {In electrospinning, polymer nanofibers are formed by the creation and elongation of an electrified fluid jet. The path of the jet is from a fluid surface that is often, but not necessarily constrained by an orifice, through a straight segment of a tapering cone, then through a series of successively smaller electrically driven bending coils, with each bending coil having turns of increasing radius, and finally solidifying into a continuous thin fiber. Control of the process produces fibers with nanometer scale diameters, along with various cross-sectional shapes, beads, branches and buckling coils or zigzags. Additions to the fluid being spun, such as chemical reagents, other polymers, dispersed particles, proteins, and viable cells, resulted in the inclusion of the added material along the nanofibers. Post-treatments of nanofibers, by conglutination, by vapor coating, by chemical treatment of the surfaces, and by thermal processing, broaden the usefulness of nanofibers.},

It explores different conceptualisations of social justice and equity, and leads the reader through a discussion of what their implications are for undertaking educational research that is both moral and ethical and how it can be enacted in the context of their chosen research method and a variety of others, both well-known and more innovative. The authors draw on real, practical examples from a range of educational contexts, including early childhood, special and inclusive education and adult education, and cultures located in both western and developing nations in order to exemplify how researchers can use methods which contribute to the creation of more equitable education systems. In this way, the authors provide a global perspective of the contrasting and creative ways in which researchers reflect on and integrate principles of social justice in their methods and their methodological decision making. It encourages the reader to think critically about their own research by asking key questions, such as: what contribution can research for equity and social justice make to new and emerging methods and methodologies? And how can researchers implement socially just research methods from a position of power? This book concludes by proposing a range of methods and methodologies which researchers can use to challenge inequality and work towards social justice, offering a springboard from which they can further their own studies." -- Provided by publisher Part one: Theorizing social justice and equity in educational research.

It is a high-efficiency and cost-effective solution-processable technique to satisfy increasing demands of large-area micro/nano-manufacturing. It is ground-breaking to direct-write sub-100 nm fibers on a rigid/flexible substrate using organic materials. A comprehensive review is presented on the research and developments related to the EHD direct-writing technique and print heads. Many developments have been presented to improve the controllability of the electrospun fibers to form high-resolution patterns and devices. EHD direct-writing is characterized by its non-contact, additive and reproducible processing, high resolution, and compatibility with organic materials. It combines dip-pen, inkjet, and electrospinning by providing the feasibility of controllable electrospinning for sub-100 nm nanofabrication, and overcomes the drawbacks of conventional electron-beam lithography, which is relatively slow, complicated and expensive. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Most butterfly wing scales have a lower lamina that prominently determines the color. Damselfly wings with protrusions have reduced thin film reflections. A limited stack of multilayers features also distinct thin film properties, as is shown for feather barbules of the bird of paradise, Lawes' parotia.

abstract = {Sibling relationships are the most enduring relationships we have, often continuing for seventy or eighty years. They are also the most egalitarian relationships. The relationships of middle childhood that seem so strongly affected by birth order develop into myriad adult relationships that are shaped by economics, circumstance, and personality. Beyond the interactions imposed by birth order, sibling relationships may be classified as sibling solidarity, fervent sibling loyalty, and sibling rivalry. It is easy to find "pure" examples of these three types of sibling relationships, but they are not always mutually exclusive and often coexist to varying degrees.},

abstract = {This paper reports a facile and maskless method for fabricating nanofluidic channel arrays using near-field electrospinning (NFES) templates with prescribed patterns and the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molding technique. Nanochannels were fabricated monolithically through three main steps: 1) direct-writing nanofiber arrays onto a silicon substrate using NFES, 2) PDMS molding of the prescribed nanofibers patterns, and 3) plasma treating PDMS substrate to promote the adhesion and bonding process. The nanochannels fabricated in this study had channel widths ranging from 500 to 1300 nm and depths of 70 to 500 nm, and were patterned in a fashion similar to the wire bonding process routinely used in the semiconductor industry. The nanochannel dimensions were predominantly dictated by electrospun nanofibers, showing that NFES is capable of depositing nanofibers with a diameter down to -50 nm. Results show that reliable and repeatable nanofluidic channel arrays were speedily fabricated at a very low cost, while nanofluidic patterns and dimensions are predominantly controlled by NFES in a directwrite, addressable manner. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

The focus is on algorithms and hence the book is well suited for students in computer science and engineering. Motivation is provided from the application areas: all solutions and techniques from computational geometry are related to particular applications in robotics, graphics, CAD/CAM, and geographic information systems. For students this motivation will be especially welcome. Modern insights in computational geometry are used to provide solutions that are both efficient and easy to understand and implement. All the basic techniques and topics from computational geometry, as well as several more advanced topics, are covered. The book is largely self-contained and can be used for self-study by anyone with a basic background in algorithms.

In this study, a modified coaxial electrospinning process was exploited to create medicated amorphous nanocomposites, an approach characterized by the application of a Teflon-coated coaxial spinneret. The hydrophilic polymer hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and the active ingredient tamoxifen citrate (TAM) were selected as the drug carrier and model drug, respectively. Their electrospun nanocomposites showed linear morphology with the drug presented in an amorphous state. The loaded cargoes could be released from the nanocomposites simultaneously when they were placed in the dissolution media, showing faster dissolution rates than their counterparts (physical mixtures). Based on the reasonable application of the polymeric carrier, the reported protocols not only provided an approach to enhance the dissolution of poorly water-soluble drugs, but also exhibited a method to facilitate the implementation of coaxial electrospinning.},

abstract = {Electrospinning is a powerful method for preparing porous materials that can be applied as biomedical materials for implantation or tissue engineering or as scaffolds for 3D cell culture experiments. However, this technique is limited in practical applications because the pore size of 3D scaffolds directly prepared by conventional electrospinning is usually less than several tens of micrometres, which may not be suitable for 3D cell culture and tissue growth. To allow for satisfactory 3D cell culture and tissue engineering, the pore size of the scaffold should be controllable according to the requirement of the specific cells to be cultured. Here, we show that layer-structured scaffolds with pore sizes larger than 100 $\mu$m can be obtained by stacking meshes prepared by direct-writing using the near-field electrospinning (NFES) technique. In the study, we prepared composite scaffolds made of polycaprolactone (PCL) and hydroxyapatite (HAp) via the above-mentioned method and tested the effectiveness of the novel scaffold in cell culture using mouse pre-osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1). The pore size and the degradability of the PCL/HAp scaffolds were characterized. The results showed that the average pore size of the scaffolds was 167 $\mu$m, which was controllable based on the required application; the degradation rate was controllable depending on the ratio of PCL to HAp. The biocompatibility of the scaffolds in vitro was studied, and it was found that the scaffolds showed no toxicity and that the cells could effectively attach, proliferate, and differentiate in the 3D skeleton of the scaffolds. Our studies showed that a simple modification of the preparation procedure can lead to a new way to fabricate novel layer-structured 3D scaffolds with controllable structures and pore sizes suitable for practical applications in implantation, tissue engineering and 3D cell culture.},

The modified NFES shows good capability in writing various orderly micro/nano patterns, such as straight and continuous lines, parallel lines, arc lines, and beads-on-string structures, whereas the conventional NFES is difficult to give a continuous writing process. Besides, the modified NFES also allows a lower electric field due to the jet initiated in a mechanical way. By finely tuning the key parameters during the modified NFES process, such as the solution property, speed of the movable collector, and the distance between the spinneret and the collector, it is likely to construct complex patterns as required on rigid or flexible substrates for a myriad of applications.},

abstract = {This new book offers a fresh approach to matrix and linear algebra by providing a balanced blend of applications, theory, and computation, while highlighting their interdependence. Intended for a one-semester course, Applied Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis places special emphasis on linear algebra as an experimental science, with numerous examples, computer exercises, and projects. While the flavor is heavily computational and experimental, the text is independent of specific hardware or software platforms. Throughout the book, significant motivating examples are woven into the text, and each section ends with a set of exercises. The student will develop a solid foundation in the following topics: Gaussian elimination and other operations with matrices; basic properties of matrix and determinant algebra; standard Euclidean spaces, both real and complex; geometrical aspects of vectors, such as norm, dot product, and angle; eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and discrete dynamical systems; general norm and inner-product concepts for abstract vector spaces. For many students, the tools of matrix and linear algebra will be as fundamental in their professional work as the tools of calculus; thus it is important to ensure that students appreciate the utility and beauty of these subjects as well as the mechanics. By including applied mathematics and mathematical modeling, this new textbook will teach students how concepts of matrix and linear algebra make concrete problems workable. Thomas S. Shores is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, where he has received awards for his teaching. His research touches on group theory, commutative algebra, mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, and inverse theory},

abstract = {About a decade ago electrospinning was primarily concerned with the preparation of nanofibers from synthetic polymers and to a lower degree from natural polymers targeting predominantly technical applications areas such as textiles and filters as well as medical areas such as tissue engineering and drug delivery. Since then strong progress has been made not only in the understanding and theoretical modeling of the complex processes governing electrospinning and in the strict control of fiber formation by material and operating parameters but also in the design of a broad range of technical spinning devices. These achievements have in turn allowed for an extension of electrospinning towards fiber formation based not only on polymers-of synthetic, biological nature-but also on metals, metal oxides, ceramics, organic/organic, organic/inorganic as well as inorganic/inorganic composite systems. Here not only preparation schemes were investigated but properties and functions of the nanofibers were analyzed and potential applications were evaluated. As far as technical applications are concerned nanofibers composed of such materials can today be designed in a highly controlled way to display specific structural features. They include phase morphology and surface topology as well as unique functions including in particular magnetic, optical, electronic, sensoric, catalytic functions specific for one-dimensional architectures. Significant developments have also been achieved towards the exploitation of such functional nanofibers in applications involving among others fuel cells, lithium ion batteries, solar cell, electronic sensors as well as photocatalysts. One major target is currently the incorporation of such functional nanofibers in micrometer-sized electronic devices or even the construction of such devices purely from nanofibers. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Liu2003,
abstract = {Increasing the ethanol concentration in the tetraethoxysilane (TEOS)-hexadecyltrimethylammmonium bromide (C16TMABr)-ammonia-water system at room temperature permits one to obtain a succession of different mesophases in the order MCM-41 → MCM-48 → lamellar phase → radial hexagonally ordered phase. First, the original hexagonal (MCM-41) phase is replaced by a cubic phase (MCM-48) and later, upon ethanol addition, by a lamellar phase. Such phase succession is the result of the cosurfactant behavior of the ethanol. At lower alcohol concentration, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows only undefined or barely spherical structures, indicating that the ethanol has only a limited effect on the external morphology. When the alcohol concentration is further increased, it will mainly act as a cosolvent producing spherical particles. A TEM study reveals the radial arrangement of the pores within the spherical particles. A hexagonal closed pore packing can be considered on a local scale around the center of the spherical particle. This hexagonal pore arrangement is the result of a combination of a very slow equilibrium toward the hydrolysis of the TEOS, its good homogenization in the synthesis solution due to the solvating effect of the alcohol, and the interference of the alcohol on the cooperative process of the micelle formation. To complete the study, parallels have been drawn with other alcohols such as methanol and propanol.},

Some challenges for developing biological tissues with bioactive glasses include incorporation of glass particles and achieving a 3D architecture mimicking natural tissues. In this study, we investigate the fabrication of scaffolds with a polymer/bioactive glass composite using near-field electrospinning (NFES). An overall controlled 3D scaffold with pores, containing random fibers, is created and aimed to provide superior cell proliferation. Highly angiogenic borate bioactive glass (13-93B3) in 20 wt.{\%} is added to polycaprolactone (PCL) to fabricate scaffolds using the NFES technique. Scaffolds measuring 5 mm × 5 mm × 0.2 mm3 in overall dimensions were seeded with human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells to investigate the cell viability. The cell viability on PCL and PCL+glass scaffolds fabricated using NFES technique and 3D printing is compared and discussed. The results indicated higher cell proliferation on 3D biomimetic scaffolds fabricated by NFES technique},

@book{Johansson2016,
abstract = {This textbook offers an introduction to the philosophy of science. It helps undergraduate students from the natural, the human and social sciences to gain an understanding of what science is, how it has developed, what its core traits are, how to distinguish between science and pseudo-science and to discover what a scientific attitude is. It argues against the common assumption that there is fundamental difference between natural and human science, with natural science being concerned with testing hypotheses and discovering natural laws, and the aim of human and some social sciences being to understand the meanings of individual and social group actions. Instead examines the similarities between the sciences and shows how the testing of hypotheses and doing interpretation/hermeneutics are similar activities. The book makes clear that lessons from natural scientists are relevant to students and scholars within the social and human sciences, and vice versa. It teaches its readers how to effectively demarcate between science and pseudo-science and sets criteria for true scientific thinking. Divided into three parts, the book first examines the question What is Science? It describes the evolution of science, defines knowledge, and explains the use of and need for hypotheses and hypothesis testing. The second half of part I deals with scientific data and observation, qualitative data and methods, and ends with a discussion of theories on the development of science. Part II offers philosophical reflections on four of the most important con cepts in science: causes, explanations, laws and models. Part III presents discussions on philosophy of mind, the relation between mind and body, value-free and value-related science, and reflections on actual trends in science.},

abstract = {While urban agriculture has long been valued for providing food security and nutrition within cities, it contributes to many other urban services that are seldom cited as rationales for protecting or even expanding urban food production. Articulating the actual and possible contributions of urban agriculture to municipal sanitation and health services is critical for sustaining these urban farms and their functions into the future. In the context of the low coverage and performance of wastewater treatment plants in Accra, Ghana, health risk reduction measures implemented on and off farm can substitute to a large extent for this absence of conventional wastewater treatment. We estimate that Accra generates approximately 80,000,000L of wastewater per day, of which urban vegetable farms alone use up to 11,250,000L. By mitigating the health risks for farmers and consumers associated with widespread wastewater irrigation, these urban farms have the potential to significantly contribute to the city's sanitation...},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {“Metabolism of Human Diseases” examines the physiology of key organs (e.g. brain, eye, lung, heart, blood vessels, blood, immune system, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, fat tissue, kidney, reproductive system, teeth, bone and joints) and how defective metabolism and signaling pathways within these organs contribute to common human diseases. The latter include depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, migraine, multiple sclerosis, Down syndrome, macular degeneration, glaucoma, asthma, COPD, pneumonia, atherosclerotic heart disease, heart failure, stroke, varicose veins, Sickle cell disease, hyperlipidemia, fever, sepsis, allergies, peptic ulcer, gastroenteritis, lactose intolerance, colon cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, gout, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, dental caries, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, breast cancer and prostate cancer. The book also describes commonly used drugs and explains their molecular targets. It provides the first comprehensive and detailed summary of the metabolism of individual organs and their physiological and pathological functioning. Thus it serves as a useful supplement to previous textbooks of human physiology. “Metabolism of Human Diseases” is a must-have, state-of-the-art textbook written by International experts for graduate students, postdocs and scientists in metabolic research, biochemistry, physiology and pharmacy as well as for physicians interested in molecular mechanisms underlying common human diseases. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Wien 2014.},

abstract = {A new highly selective, chromogenic, and fluorogenic Cu2+ chemosensor, fluorescein-N-methylimidazole conjugate 1, and another fluorescein-N-imidazole conjugate 2 were synthesized and investigated by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. The sensing of Cu2+ quenches the emission band of 1 at $\lambda$max = 525 nm, with an association constant (K a = 1.0 x 107 M-1) and a stoichiometry of 1:1 in a buffered H2O: MeOH solution (4:1, pH = 7.4). The Cu2+ detection limit for chemosensor 1 is 37 nM. The presence of the N-methyl group in 1 increased the Cu2+ binding selectivity, resulting in a stronger binding constant and a broader pH working range (pH 5-10) in comparison to 2. The fluorescence in 1 and 2 is caused by electron transfer phenomenon from the imidazole nitrogen to fluorescein, which is readily inhibited by Cu2+ binding.},

The shrinkage and elongation of these polymer fibers during the pyrolysis process was observed to depend on the height of the supporting walls. We demonstrate that this shrinkage and elongation during pyrolysis strongly influences the resulting carbon electrical properties. Compared to fibers that retained their length during pyrolysis, conductivity was enhanced by a factor of seven after fibers were elongated four times their initial pre-pyrolysis length with a concurrent shrinkage of their diameter by half. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The reuse of treated wastewater, in particular for irrigation, is an increasingly common practice, encouraged by governments and official entities worldwide. Irrigation with wastewater may have implications at two different levels: alter the physicochemical and microbiological properties of the soil and/or introduce and contribute to the accumulation of chemical and biological contaminants in soil. The first may affect soil productivity and fertility; the second may pose serious risks to the human and environmental health. The sustainable wastewater reuse in agriculture should prevent both types of effects, requiring a holistic and integrated risk assessment. In this article we critically review possible effects of irrigation with treated wastewater, with special emphasis on soil microbiota. The maintenance of a rich and diversified autochthonous soil microbiota and the use of treated wastewater with minimal levels of potential soil contaminants are proposed as sine qua non conditions to achieve a sustainable wastewater reuse for irrigation.},

abstract = {A simple patterning process combining near-field electrospinning (NFE) and template lithography, called near-field electrospinning-assisted lithography (NFEAL), was developed to prepare polymeric scaffolds with microgroove patterns for potential use in biomedical applications. NFE enabled the deposition of poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) fibers at a desired position. The diameters of the deposited PEO fibers could be controlled over a range of 0.5–20 $\mu$m by adjusting the NFE parameters such as voltage, distance, feed rate, and translation speed. The preparation of PEO fibers with 1 and 3 $\mu$m diameters using NFE, followed by the deposition of polystyrene (PS) and removal of the fiber template, created free-standing PS scaffolds with microgroove patterns. The width of the microgroove was similar to the diameter of the PEO fibers. The depth of the microgroove was also dependent on the dimensions of the PEO fibers; microgrooves of depth 64.49 ± 11.5 nm and 216.68 ± 62.9 nm were fabricated from PEO fibers of diameters 1 and 3 $\mu$m, respectively. When C2C12 cells were cultured on the microgrooved scaffolds, they showed enhanced elongation or alignment along the microgrooved scaffolds, especially, for the microgroove (1 $\mu$m) with a smaller width.},

Choosing the best solvent, being aware of potential problems, and the recovery of solvents has never been so important. Traditionally, solvents had been chosen on the basis of whether they can do the job effectively and economically. However, with regulations on exposure to solvent vapors becoming more stringent, selecting the solvent that meets regulatory, efficiency, and economical criteria as early as possible in the process has become paramount. Solvent Recovery Handbook, Second Edition sets out the physical properties of the fifty most commonly used solvents. The book supplies information on their behavior during and after use, health and fire hazards, the photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP), and recovery processes including practical aspects of the design and operation of batch stills. It delivers state-of-the art coverage of every available recovery and disposal technology - including removing solvents from gas, water, and residues, separating used solvents, and drying solvents. What's more, you'll find fact-filled sections on the latest equipment, safe effective operating procedures, choosing solvents with recovery in mind, and much more.Updated and expanded, Ian Smallwood's Solvent Recovery Handbook, Second Edition hands you all the practical tools you need to efficiently and cost-effectively process harmful organic solvents after re-capture.},

abstract = {This well-known introductory textbook gives a uniform presentation of nuclear and particle physics from an experimental point of view. The first part, Analysis, is devoted to disentangling the substructure of matter. This part shows that experiments designed to uncover the substructures of nuclei and nucleons have a similar conceptual basis, and lead to the present picture of all matter being constructed from a small number of elementary building blocks and a small number of fundamental interactions. The second part, Synthesis, shows how the elementary particles may be combined to build hadrons and nuclei. The fundamental interactions, which are responsible for the forces in all systems, become less and less evident in increasingly complex systems. Such systems are in fact dominated by many-body phenomena. A section on neutrino oscillations and one on nuclear matter at high temperatures bridge the field of "nuclear and particle physics" and "modern astrophysics and cosmology". The fourth edition includes new developments, in particular a new section on the double beta decay including a discussion of the possibility for a neutrinoless decay and its implications for the standard model. The concise text is based on lectures held at the University of Heidelberg. It has been translated into many languages and has become a standard reference for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses and includes numerous exercises with worked answers. Book jacket.},

The in vitro serum stability tests indicate the particle size of the micelles was very stable during the serum absorption. The turbidity test reveals that the prepared micelles were very stable under phosphate buffered saline environment, which can prevent the blurred vision. The loading efficiency of metipranolol in micelles can be as high as 83{\%}. Finally, the in vitro and in vivo studies indicate the pluronic micelles modified by chitosan have sustained release behavior and good pharmacological response.

Among the various precursors to produce CNFs, PAN has been extensively studied due to its high carbon yield and flexibility for tailoring the structure of the final CNFs as well as the ease of obtaining stabilized products due to the formation of a ladder structure via nitrile polymerization. In view of this, they have applications in areas such as electronics, tissue engineering, membrane filtration and high performance composites. This review presents various combinations of PAN and PAN-based precursors in producing CNFs from the PAN homopolymer or its modified precursors, copolymers, blends and various composites.

abstract = {The goal of this book is to expose the reader to the indispensable role that mathematics---often very abstract---plays in modern physics. Starting with the notion of vector spaces, the first half of the book develops topics as diverse as algebras, classical orthogonal polynomials, Fourier analysis, complex analysis, differential and integral equations, operator theory, and multi-dimensional Green's functions. The second half of the book introduces groups, manifolds, Lie groups and their representations, Clifford algebras and their representations, and fiber bundles and their applications to differential geometry and gauge theories. This second edition is a substantial revision of the first one with a complete rewriting of many chapters and the addition of new ones, including chapters on algebras, representation of Clifford algebras and spinors, fiber bundles, and gauge theories. The spirit of the first edition, namely the balance between rigor and physical application, has been maintained, as is the abundance of historical notes and worked out examples that demonstrate the "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics" in modern physics. Einstein has famously said, "The most incomprehensible thing about nature is that it is comprehensible." What he had in mind was reiterated in another one of his famous quotes concerning the question of how " {\ldots} mathematics, being after all a product of human thought, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality." It is a question that comes to everyone's mind when encountering the highly abstract mathematics required for a deep understanding of modern physics. It is the experience that Eugene Wigner so profoundly described as "the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences.".},

The alkoxysilane site of CSDA is co-condensed with inorganic precursors; the ammonium site of CSDA, attached to silicon atoms incorporated into the wall, electrostatically interacts with the anionic surfactants to produce well-ordered anionic-surfactant-templated mesoporous silicas (AMS). These have new structures with periodic modulations as well as two-dimensional hexagonal and lamellar phases. The periodic modulations may be caused by the coexistence of micelles that differ in size or curvature, possibly owing to local chirality. These mesoporous silicas provide a new family of mesoporous materials as well as shedding light on the structural behaviour of anionic surfactants.},

abstract = {Nanofibers of a commercial styrene-butadiene-styrene triblock copolymer were electrospun from solution, and collected either as a nonwoven elastomeric fabric, or on a layer of graphite that was evaporated onto a glass microscope slide. The resulting nanofibers were elastic, birefringent, and most had diameters around 100 nm. A few thin, beaded fibers were found among the smooth nanofibers. The diameter of the fibers between the beads was as small as 3 nm. After staining with osmium tetroxide, the nanofibers were examined using transmission electron microscopy. Separated phases of styrene and butadiene blocks were observed. The single-phase domains were irregular in shape, but elongated along the axis of the fiber. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns showed a weak indication of molecular orientation along the fiber axis, and the birefringence confirmed that such orientation was present. The single-phase domains grew larger in nanofibers that were held at room temperature (approximately 25 °C) for several days. Annealing at a temperature 70 °C greatly accelerated the growth of the single-phase domains. The nanofibers softened and flattened on the evaporated graphite during annealing.},

General examination revealed that the patient was afebrile but in severe pain. Abdominal examination showed generalized tenderness and guarding of the abdomen with ‘board like' rigidity. Laboratory investigations were essentially normal. A clinical diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer was made. An erect chest x-ray (CXR) (Fig. 1a) and a supine abdominal x-ray (AXR) (Fig. 1b) were performed as initial investigations. Questions: (1) What abnormality can you see? (2) What is the diagnosis? Case 2: A 69-year-old man with good past health complained of colicky abdominal pain, increasing abdominal distension, vomiting and constipation. On general examination he was afebrile, dehydrated and tachycardic. Abdominal examination showed a distended abdomen with visible peristalsis, and there was generalized abdominal tenderness but no mass could be palpated. Auscultation revealed tinkling and accentuated bowel sounds. There was no abdominal scar to indicate previous surgery. Laboratory investigations showed slightly elevated urea (probably related to dehydration) but were otherwise normal. A supine abdominal radiograph of this patient was performed (Fig. 2a). Questions: (1) What radiological abnormalities can you identify on this radiograph? - There are multiple dilated bowel loops roughly central abdominal in location. - Valvulae conniventes appearing as striations crossing completely across the width of the bowel loops.

@article{Malkin2014,
abstract = {The basics of the uniaxial stretching of polymer melts and solutions are considered, including analysis of the transient regimes of deformation, as well as the different types of instability in the final stage of stretching which result in breakup of the systems in question. A steady flow can be realized only at low deformation rates. Increase in the strain rate leads to large draw ratios that can be reached only by development of elastic (reversible) deformations of a polymer, while the flow (irreversible deformations) is practically suppressed. High rate deformations of polymer melts and solutions consisting of entangled chains are quite similar to the stretching of cured rubber. Quantitative conditions of breakup for polymer melts are also similar to the rupture of cured rubber. Thus, one can treat high rate large elastic deformations of linear polymers in stretching as strain-induced transition to the rubber-like state. This mechanism of extensional deformations is clearly seen in experiments with linear monodisperse polymers. However, similar physical processes also take place for polydisperse and branched polymers, though they are more complicated; and special phenomena such as strain hardening are observed. In the stretching of dilute or semi-dilute solutions, surface effects begin to play an essential role. However, in this case, elasticity also stabilizes a stream, creating a highly oriented core within a filament. In dilute solutions, a solvent forms a regular structure on this core ("bead-on-a-string" structure) while in entanglement solutions, it is squeezed out of a filament, forming separate drops. The latter is reminiscent of the stress-induced phase separation effect. Concentration redistribution along and across a filament then occurs, leading to modification of its temporal and spatial rheological properties. A special case of strong (high strain rate) stretching of polymer solutions is electrospinning, which is accompanied by loss of solvent. In all cases of high rate stretching, elastic deformations inherently related to macromolecules are dominant. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Highly ordered aluminum dimple arrays measuring 530-670 nm in diameter were formed on an aluminum substrate via etidronic acid anodizing at 210-270 V and subsequent anodic oxide dissolution. The nanostructured aluminum surface led to bright structural coloration with a rainbow spectrum, and the reflected wavelength strongly depends on the angle of the specimen and the period of the dimple array. The reflection peak shifts gradually with the dimple diameter toward longer wavelength, reaching 800 nm in wavelength at 670 nm in diameter. The shape of the aluminum dimple arrays were successfully transferred to a mercapto-ester ultra-violet curable polymer via self-assembled monolayer coating and polymer replications using a nanoimprinting technique. The nanostructured polymer surfaces with positively and negatively shaped dimple arrays also exhibited structural coloration based on the periodic nanostructure, and reflected light mostly in the visible region, 400-800 nm. This nanostructuring with structural coloration can be easily realized by simple techniques such as anodizing, SAM coating, and nanoimprinting.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

However, the metal foils currently used as thermal reflective screens are easily oxidized in an oxidizing environment. Nanoscale yttrium oxide exhibits high reflectivity in the near-infrared (NIR) region, as well as excellent stability in an oxidizing environment. The material also shows potential for application as a high-temperature reflective screen. A high near-infrared reflective Y2O3 nanofiber membrane was successfully prepared by electrospinning a synthetic polyacetylacetone‑yttrium (PAY) precursor into precursor fibers, followed by heat treatment. The new polyorganometallic precursor PAY with 42{\%} Y2O3 content was synthesized by adjusting the ratio of acetylacetone to YCl3{\textperiodcentered}6H2O. The crystallization, microstructure and NIR reflectivity of the Y2O3 nanofiber membrane were analyzed. The tensile strength of the Y2O3 nanofiber membrane was evaluated. The strength of the Y2O3 nanofiber membrane with good flexibility, prefect morphology and high crystallinity could reach 1.6 MPa, and its NIR reflectivity could reach 95{\%}. High-temperature heat-reflective testing shows that the Y2O3 nanofiber membrane exerts a reflective effect on thermal radiation at 1500 °C. It could be continuously used as a reflective screen for high-temperature insulation materials in a high-temperature oxidizing environment.},

By manipulating the flying trajectory and solidification degree of the micro/nano jet, the solidified micro/nanofiber flying in a stabilized helical manner and versatile serpentine structures deposited on a moving collector have been achieved. Systematic experiments and theoretical analysis were conducted to study the transformation behavior and the size changing rules for various deposited microstructures, and highly aligned serpentine microfibers were directly written by controlling the applied voltage, nozzle-to-collector distance and collector velocity. Furthermore, a hyper-stretchable piezoelectric device that can detect stretching, bending and pressure has been successfully fabricated using the printed serpentine micro/nanofibers, demonstrating the potential of HE-printing in stretchable electronics manufacturing.},

abstract = {Over the last couple of decades, Carbon Nanowires (CNWs) have found important applications in the field of rapid label-free biosensing platforms for their excellent electrical, thermal and chemical properties. Despite the growing interest in incorporating these materials into sensitive analytical devices, there has been limited research efforts that explore the realistic incorporation of these structures into broader microsystems. The present dissertation explores two Advanced Additive Manufacturing (AdAM) techniques for the fabrication of CNWs with promising characteristics for sensing applications. The first technique, Electro-Mechanical Spinning (EMS) is a relatively new method for the production of CNWs with highly-oriented patterning capabilities, and is assessed in terms of the minimum feature sizes that it can attain reproducibly. The second method, Multiple Photon Polymerization (MPP) is a mature laser manufacturing technique that offers high repeatability, yet it has remained largely unexplored in the field of carbon materials. This work presents a study of how MPP can be used to create CNWs in terms of micro-fabrication parameters like laser power and scanning velocity. A thorough review study of the surface properties required for carbon materials to become eligible candidates in biosensing is also included in this dissertation. Lastly, an application of CNWs is presented, in which a Joule Heating technique is used to induce controlled breaking of the wires to produce nano-scale separated carbon electrodes, which hold potential for micro/nano particle manipulation in microfluidics.},

These methods utilize photochemistry induced by multiphoton absorption and are carried out using essentially identical equipment. Fabrication of 2D microstructured substrates, complex 3D scaffolds, containing actively induced topographies, and immobilization of biomolecules in a spatially defined manner was demonstrated with these techniques.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. A first-principle investigation of structures and properties of NinPdn(n=1-5) clusters is presented. For this study, the linear combination of Gaussian-type orbitals auxiliary density functional theory (LCGTO-ADFT) method has been employed. In order to determine the lowest energy structures, several isomers in different spin multiplicities were studied, for each cluster size. Initial structures, for which successive geometry optimization was computed without any constrain, were taken along Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) trajectories. To discriminate between minima and transition state structures, harmonic frequency analyses were performed at the optimized structures. Ground state structures, bond lengths, harmonic frequencies, dissociation energy, ionization potential, electron affinity and spin density plots are presented. This work demonstrates, that the Pd atoms prefer to allocate on the surface of the cluster structures whose core is formed by the 3d TM atoms type. Moreover, it has been observed that the ground-state structure spin multiplicity increases as the system size grows. The results of this study contribute to gain insight into how structures and energy properties change with cluster size in bimetallic Pd-based alloys.},

The dispersion and interaction of carbon nanotube in liquid crystal matrices and more elaborately the effect of dispersion on the properties of liquid crystalline materials has been extensively discussed. Recent progress has shown that even a very minute concentration of carbon nanotube in liquid crystals can have a reflective impact on the electrical and optical properties of liquid crystals. Liquid crystals provide a distinctive environment for controlling the alignment of carbon nanotubes whereas carbon nanotubes are important for the enhancement and fine-tuning of liquid crystalline properties. Potential applications of liquid crystal and carbon nanotube suspension are briefly discussed. Conclusion and future perspectives of this rapidly emerging field is provided at the end.},

@article{Xue2014,
abstract = {Cellular behavior is strongly influenced by the architecture and pattern of its interfacing extracellular matrix (ECM). For an artificial culture system which could eventually benefit the translation of scientific findings into therapeutic development, the system should capture the key characteristics of a physiological microenvironment. At the same time, it should also enable standardized, high throughput data acquisition. Since an ECM is composed of different fibrous proteins, studying cellular interaction with individual fibrils will be of physiological relevance. In this study, we employ near-field electrospinning to create ordered patterns of collagenous fibrils of gelatin, based on an acetic acid and ethyl acetate aqueous co-solvent system. Tunable conformations of micro-fibrils were directly deposited onto soft polymeric substrates in a single step. We observe that global topographical features of straight lines, beads-on-strings, and curls are dictated by solution conductivity; whereas the finer details such as the fiber cross-sectional profile are tuned by solution viscosity. Using these fibril constructs as cellular assays, we study EA.hy926 endothelial cells' response to ROCK inhibition, because of ROCK's key role in the regulation of cell shape. The fibril array was shown to modulate the cellular morphology towards a pre-capillary cord-like phenotype, which was otherwise not observed on a flat 2-D substrate. Further facilitated by quantitative analysis of morphological parameters, the fibril platform also provides better dissection in the cells' response to a H1152 ROCK inhibitor. In conclusion, the near-field electrospun fibril constructs provide a more physiologically-relevant platform compared to a featureless 2-D surface, and simultaneously permit statistical single-cell image cytometry using conventional microscopy systems. The patterning approach described here is also expected to form the basics for depositing other protein fibrils, seen among potential applications as culture platforms for drug screening.},

High-speed videography showed that the additional centrifugal field effectively removed electrical bending instability and promoted molecular orientation during the electrospinning process. Infrared spectroscopic (IR) characterization revealed that the fraction of trans-trans conformers in BPAPC nanofibers reached 67{\%} under optimal electrospinning conditions (25 kV and 1800 rpm at 25 °C). Modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD) assays showed that a degree of crystallinity of 6.5{\%} could be achieved. Moreover, two crystal phases at angles of 2$\theta$ = 17.3° and 21.9° were produced in BPAPC nanofibers. The elastic modulus of BPAPC nanofibers with a crystallinity of 6.5{\%} was 7.11 and 5.13 GPa, as measured via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and nanoindenter (NI) experiments, respectively. These results demonstrated that the mechanical behavior of BPAPC nanofibers could be improved by conducting the proposed electrospinning technique. Moreover, BPAPC nanofibers produced through the proposed method could be potentially applied for the reinforcement of composites. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In this text the next steps are taken to teach you how to handle large amounts of data efficiently. A number of algorithms are introduced and the need for them is motivated through examples that bring meaning to the problems we face as computer programmers. An algorithm is a well-defined procedure for accom- plishing a task. Algorithms are an important part of Computer Science and this text explores many algorithms to give you the background you need when writing programs of your own. The goal is that having seen some of the sorts of algorithms presented in this text, you will be able to apply these techniques to other programs you write in the future. Another goal of this text is to introduce you to the idea of computational complexity. While there are many unique and interesting algorithms that we could explore, it is important to understand that some algorithms are more efficient than others. While computers are very good at doing calculations quickly, an inefficient algorithm can make the fastest computer seem very slow or even make it appear to come to a halt. This text will show you what can and cannot be computed effi- ciently. The text builds this idea of efficiency from the most basic of facts giving you the tools you will need to determine just how efficient any algorithm is so you can make informed judgements about the programs you write. v},

abstract = {Urban agriculture may have a role to play in addressing urban food insecurity problems, which are bound to become increasingly important with the secular trend towards the urbanization of poverty and of population in developing regions. Our understanding of the importance, nature and food security implications of urban agriculture is however plagued by a lack of good quality, reliable data. While studies based on survey data do exist for several major cities, much of the evidence is still qualitative if not anecdotal. Using a recently created dataset bringing together comparable, nationally representative household survey data for 15 developing or transition countries, this paper analyzes in a comparative international perspective the importance of urban agriculture for the urban poor and food insecure. Some clear hints do come from our analysis. On the one hand, the potential for urban agriculture to play a substantial role in urban poverty and food insecurity reduction should not be overemphasised, as its share in income and overall agricultural production is often quite limited. On the other hand, though, its role should also not be too easily dismissed, particularly in much of Africa and in all those countries in which agriculture provides a substantial share of income for the urban poor, and for those groups of households to which it constitutes an important source of livelihoods. We also find fairly consistent evidence of a positive statistical association between engagement in urban agriculture and dietary adequacy indicators.},

abstract = {The use of carbon nanomaterials in various applications requires precise control of their surface and bulk properties. In this paper, we present a strategy for modifying the surface chemistry, wettability, and electrical conductivity of carbon tubes and films through annealing in a vacuum. Experiments were conducted with 60-300 nm nanotubes (nanopipes), produced by noncatalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in a porous alumina template, and with thin films deposited by the same technique on a glassy carbon substrate having the same structure and chemistry of the CNTs. The surface of the as-produced CVD-carbon, treated with sodium hydroxide to remove the alumina template, is hydrophilic, and the bulk electrical conductivity is lower by a factor of 20 than that of fully graphitic multiwalled nanotubes (MWNT) or bulk graphite. The bulk electrical conductivity increases to the conductivity of graphite after annealing at 2000 °C in a high vacuum. The analysis of CNTs by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy shows the ordering of carbon accompanied by an exponential increase of the in-plane crystallite size, La, with increasing annealing temperature. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) was used to study the interaction of CNT with water, and contact angle measurements performed using the sessile drop method on CVDcarbon films demonstrate that the contact angle increases nearly linearly with increasing annealing temperature. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Light transport algorithms generate realistic images by simulating the emission and scattering of light in an artificial environment. Applications include lighting design, architecture, and computer animation, while related engineering disciplines include neutron transport and radiative heat transfer. The main challenge with these algorithms is the high complexity of the geometric, scattering, and illumination models that are typically used. In this dissertation, we develop new Monte Carlo techniques that greatly extend the range of input models for which light transport simulations are practical. Our contributions include new theoretical models, statistical methods, and rendering algorithms. We start by developing a rigorous theoretical basis for bidirectional light transport algorithms (those that combine direct and adjoint techniques). First, we propose a linear operator formulation that does not depend on any assumptions about the physical validity of the input scene. We show how to obtain mathematically correct results using a variety of bidirectional techniques. Next we derive a different formulation, such that for any physically valid input scene, the transport operators are symmetric. This symmetry is important for both theory and implementations, and is based on a new reciprocity condition that we derive for transmissive materials. Finally, we show how light transport can be formulated as an integral over a space of paths. This framework allows new sampling and integration techniques to be applied, such as the Metropolis sampling algorithm. We also use this model to investigate the limitations of unbiased Monte Carlo methods, and to show that certain kinds of paths cannot be sampled. Our statistical contributions include a new technique called multiple importance sampling, which can greatly increase the robustness of Monte Carlo integration. It uses more than one sampling technique to evaluate an integral, and then combines these samples in a way that is provably close to optimal. This leads to estimators that have low variance for a broad class of integrands. We also describe a new variance reduction technique called efficiency-optimized Russian roulette. Finally, we link these ideas together to obtain new Monte Carlo light transport algorithms. Bidirectional path tracing uses a family of different path sampling techniques that generate some path vertices starting from a light source, and some starting from a sensor. We show that when these techniques are combined using multiple importance sampling, a large range of difficult lighting effects can be handled efficiently. The algorithm is unbiased, handles arbitrary geometry and materials, and is relatively simple to implement. The second algorithm we describe is Metropolis light transport, inspired by the Metropolis sampling method from computational physics. Paths are generated by following a random walk through path space, such that the probability density of visiting each path is proportional to the contribution it makes to the ideal image. The resulting algorithm is unbiased, uses little storage, handles arbitrary geometry and materials, and can be orders of magnitude more efficient than previous unbiased approaches. It performs especially well on problems that are usually considered difficult, e.g. those involving bright indirect light, small geometric holes, or glossy surfaces. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the Metropolis method to transport problems of any kind.},

DESIGN Data were analyzed from a cross-sectional random phone survey conducted in 2003. A quota sampling strategy was used to ensure that all census tracts within the city were represented. SETTING Flint, Michigan. PARTICIPANTS 766 adults. VARIABLES MEASURED Fruit and vegetable intake was measured using questionnaire items from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Household participation in a community garden was assessed by asking the respondent if he or she, or any member of the household, had participated in a community garden project in the last year. ANALYSIS Generalized linear models and logistic regression models assessed the association between household participation in a community garden and fruit and vegetable intake, controlling for demographic, neighborhood participation, and health variables. RESULTS Adults with a household member who participated in a community garden consumed fruits and vegetables 1.4 more times per day than those who did not participate, and they were 3.5 times more likely to consume fruits and vegetables at least 5 times daily. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Household participation in a community garden may improve fruit and vegetable intake among urban adults.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Robotics provides the basic know-how on the foundations of robotics: modelling, planning and control. The text develops around a core of consistent and rigorous formalism with fundamental and technological material giving rise naturally and with gradually increasing difficulty to more advanced considerations. The theory of manipulator structures presented in the early part of the book encompasses: • the fundamentals: kinematics, statics and trajectory planning; and • the technology of actuators, sensors and control units. Subsequently, more advanced instruction is given in: • dynamics and motion control of robot manipulators; • environmental interaction using exteroceptive sensory data (force and vision); • mobile robots; and • motion planning. Appendices ensure that students will have access to a consistent level of background in basic areas such as rigid-body mechanics, feedback control, and others. Problems are raised and the proper tools established to find engineering-oriented solutions rather than to focus on abstruse theoretical methodology. To impart practical skill, more than 60 examples and case studies are carefully worked out and interwoven through the text, with frequent resort to simulation. In addition, nearly 150 end-of-chapter problems are proposed, and the book is accompanied by a pdf solutions manual and MATLAB{\textregistered} code for computer problems; these are available free of charge to those adopting Robotics as a textbook for courses. This text is suitable for use in senior undergraduate and graduate courses in automation and computer, electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering courses with strong robotics content.},

abstract = {Here, a novel melt electrospinning method to produce few-micron and nanometer thick fibers is presented, in which a polymer-coated wire with a sharp tip is used as the polymer source. The polymer coating is melted via Joule heating of the source wire and extracted toward the target via electrostatic forces. The high viscosity and low charge density of polymer melts lower their stretchability in melt. The method relies on confining the Taylor cone and reducing initial jet diameter via concentrated electrostatic fields as a means to reduce the diameter of fibers. As a result, the initial jet diameter and the final fiber diameter are reduced by an order of magnitude of three to ten times, respectively, using wire melt electrospinning compared to syringe- and edge-based electrospinning. The fiber diameter melt electrospun via this novel method is 1.0 ± 0.9 µm, considerably thinner than conventional melt electrospinning techniques. The generation of thin fibers are explained in terms of the electrostatic field around the wire tip, as obtained from finite element analysis (FEA), which controls the size and shape of the melt electrospun jet.},

This review summarizes advancements in the last ten years in the design and fabrication of hierarchically structured polymer fibers via electrospinning technologies, including a diversity of electrospinning devices and electrospinning parameters using various polymers. These well-defined, multilevel structures enable the fibers to be used more effectively in applications in the biomedical field, such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, and diagnostics. This review can provide a better understanding of the relationships between the structure and functionality of polymer fibers for further biomedical applications.},

A novel method for the direct determination of critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the surfactants using flow-injection CL is described. Under the optimum conditions, the luminescence intensity of the Luminol-H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} system increased gradually with increasing concentration of the surfactants before the CMC, but rapidly reached to the emission maximum at the CMC, followed by a decrease after the CMC. The concentrations of the surfactants corresponding to the luminescence maximum are in agreement with the literature CMC values. The main factors affecting the determination of CMC are discussed. The mechanistic studies show that the luminescence peaks observed in the experiment were mainly because of the protective effect of the micelle against the transition of the excited species and the retarding effect of the micelle structures on the CL reaction rate.},

The Marangoni flow is generated by the pH gradient in a maze filled with an alkaline solution of a fatty acid by introducing a hydrogel block soaked with an acid at the exit. The pH gradient changes the protonation rate of fatty acid molecules, which translates into the surface tension gradient at the liquid-air interface through the maze. Fluid flow maintained by the surface tension gradient (Marangoni flow) can drag water-soluble dye particles toward low pH (exit) at the liquid-air interface. Dye particles placed at the entrance of the maze dissolve during this motion, thus exhibiting and finding the shortest path and all possible paths in a maze. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Eight persons from five institutions in different countries carried out polymerizations of aniline following the same preparation protocol. In a "standard" procedure, aniline hydrochloride was oxidized with ammonium peroxydisulfate in aqueous medium at ambient temperature. The yield of polyaniline was higher than 90 {\%} in all cases. The electrical conductivity of polyaniline hydrochloride thus prepared was 4.4 ± 1.7 S cm-1 (average of 59 samples), measured at room temperature. A product with defined electrical properties could be obtained in various laboratories by following the same synthetic procedure. The influence of reduced reaction temperature and increased acidity of the polymerization medium on polyaniline conductivity were also addressed. The conductivity changes occurring during the storage of polyaniline were monitored. The density of polyaniline hydrochloride was 1.329 g cm-3. The average conductivity of corresponding polyaniline bases was 1.4 × 10-8 S cm-1, the density being 1.245 g cm-3. Additional changes in the conductivity take place during storage. Aging is more pronounced in powders than in compressed samples. As far as aging effects are concerned, their assessment is relative. The observed reduction in the conductivity by ∼10 {\%} after more than one-year storage is large but, compared with the low conductivity of corresponding polyaniline (PANI) base, such a change is negligible. For most applications, an acceptable level of conductivity may be maintained throughout the expected lifetime.},

The Kjeldahl and Dumas methods measure nitrogen. Infrared spectroscopy is based on absorption of a wavelength of infrared radiation specific for the peptide bond. Copper-peptide bond interactions contribute to the analysis by the biuret, Lowry, and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) methods. Specific amino acids are involved in the Lowry, BCA, dye-binding, and UV 280 nm methods. The BCA method also utilizes the reducing power of proteins in an alkaline solution. These and other protein analysis methods differ in their speed and sensitivity. Because of the complex nature of various food systems, problems may be encountered to different degrees in protein analysis by available methods. Certain methods are required as official methods for nutrition labeling, rapid methods may be suitable for quality control purposes, and other very sensitive methods are required for work with a minute amount of protein.},

Metal oxides nanostructuration, preparation with the various morphologies, and their coupling with other structures enhance the unique properties of the materials and open new perspectives for their application in the food industry. Chemical gas sensors that are based on semiconducting metal oxide materials can detect the presence of toxins and volatile organic compounds that are produced in food products due to their spoilage and hazardous processes that may take place during the food aging and transportation. Metal oxide nanomaterials can be used in food processing, packaging, and the preservation industry as well. Moreover, the metal oxide-based nanocomposite structures can provide many advantageous features to the final food packaging material, such as antimicrobial activity, enzyme immobilization, oxygen scavenging, mechanical strength, increasing the stability and the shelf life of food, and securing the food against humidity, temperature, and other physiological factors. In this paper, we review the most recent achievements on the synthesis of metal oxide-based nanostructures and their applications in food quality monitoring and active and intelligent packaging.},

abstract = {The mathematical concept of fractals is widely applied to photonics as planar structures ranging from terahertz resonators, optical antennas, to photodetectors. Here, instead of a direct mathematical abstract, we design a plasmonic leaf with fractal geometry from the outline of a leaf from Wargrave Pink. The enhanced light-matter interactions are observed numerically from the improvement in both absorption and near-field intensification. To demonstrate the effect experimentally, a three-dimensional fractal structure is realised through direct laser writing, which significantly improves the photothermal conversion. By virtue of the self-similarity in geometry, the artificial leaf improves the absorption of a 10-nm-thick gold film with 14 × temperature increment compared to flat Au film. Not limited to the proof-of-concept photothermal experiment demonstrated here, the fractal structure with improved light-matter interactions can be utilised in a variety of applications ranging from non-linear harmonic generation, plasmonic-enhanced fluorescence, to hot electron generation for photocatalysis.},

After the presentation of heat transfer processes involving the influence of surface tension and wettability, this paper is organized according to the nature of the nanoparticles dealing with oxide, carbon-based and metallic nanofluids as well as unusual or less considered nature of nanoparticles. The factors affecting the surface tension of nanofluids are relatively well identified, but concentration and surfactant effects present some inconsistent outcomes. In any case, the dispersion of nanoparticles have an effect on the surface tension of base fluid significantly lower than that on transport properties. Based on results available in the literature and existing empirical correlations, a comprehensive assessment, challenges and future works are suggested.},

A similar transition was also observed in S. cerevisiae chromatin. This process did not involve core histone dissociation from the chromatin, and the persistence length after the transition was26 nm for S. pombe and 28 nm for S. cerevisiae, indicating a salt-induced unfolding to beads-on-a-string fibers.

In the last century alone, we have observed four major influenza A virus pandemics as well as the emergence of three highly pathogenic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As no effective antiviral treatments or vaccines are presently available against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to understand the host response to this virus as this may guide the efforts in development towards novel therapeutics. Here, we offer the first in-depth characterization of the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems. Our data demonstrate the each virus elicits both core antiviral components as well as unique transcriptional footprints. Compared to the response to influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a muted response that lacks robust induction of a subset of cytokines including the Type I and Type III interferons as well as a numerous chemokines. Taken together, these data suggest that the unique transcriptional signature of this virus may be responsible for the development of COVID-19.},

abstract = {Electrospun (bio)polymeric fibers have attracted widespread interest as functional materials with suitable morphology and properties for their use as tissue engineering scaffolds and/or wound dressings. The fibrous/porous morphology of this type of materials promotes the adhesion and proliferation of tissue cells, but on the other hand, pathogenic microorganisms unfortunately can also be attached to the fibers, thus leading to serious infections and consequently to the immediate removal of the scaffolds or wound dressings, which may imply greater tissue damage. In this context, this review addresses the more recent approaches based on electrospinning and related techniques for developing composite (bio)polymeric fibers with tailored antimicrobial properties either by using mere electrospinning for the incorporation of well-defined antimicrobial nanoparticles (silver, gold, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, copper oxide, etc.) or by resorting to the combination of electrospraying and electrospinning for the generation of nanoparticle-coated fibers, as well as coaxial electrospinning for obtaining fibers with nanoparticle-rich surface.},

Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) was electrosprayed onto semiconducting and insulating substrates using both DC and AC potentials. On the semiconducting substrate, both AC and DC methods were capable of producing significant CMC coverage. However, only the AC potential was capable of producing significant coverage on the insulating substrate, possibly due to a reduction in the amount of surface charging. In the electrospinning investigation, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) fibers were spun into mats using both DC and AC driving potentials. The AC potential resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of fiber 'whipping' and the resulting mats exhibited a higher degree of fiber alignment but were observed to contain more residual solvent. The average fiber diameter for both DC and AC-spun mats exhibited a strong dependence on solution concentration. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The liquefaction of waste woody materials in the presence of phenol and acid catalyst is a promising method for converting waste woody materials into phenolic resin. The condensation reaction during the liquefaction process is a major problem for its practical application. The effects of various reaction conditions on the extent of the condensation reaction were investigated. The residue content, molecular weight distributions and phenol concentration were measured to investigate the condensation reaction. As a result, it was observed that the intense reaction conditions caused fast liquefaction and led to a remarkable condensation reaction. It was also found that the residue content began to increase at an earlier reaction time when a more remarkable condensation reaction occurred. These results indicated that the condensation reaction was one of the causes for too much degradation of liquefied wood molecules under intense liquefaction. The phenol concentrations in the liquefaction products were measured to investigate their effect on the condensation reaction. It was shown that the phenol concentration was 8{\%} lower at the end of the reaction when the condensation reaction was high. It was indicated that the drop in phenol concentration suppressed the liquefaction and promoted the condensation reaction. The addition of methanol during the liquefaction process suppressed the condensation reaction. The residue content was 11{\%} when 50{\%} methanol was added, while it reached 66{\%} when methanol was not added. This can be because methanol reduced the bound phenol, which could be a reaction site of condensation reaction.},

abstract = {An optical waveguide sensor was fabricated by forming a multilayer film made by porous anodic alumina (PAA) and Al layers on a glass substrate. The fabricated sensor system was based on the monitoring of a waveguide coupling mode, which is sensitive to the change in the refractive index of the PAA layer caused by collection of target molecules into the pores of the PAA layer. The PAA/Al multilayer film was formed by partial anodization of an Al film deposited on the glass substrate, and the waveguide coupling mode was examined by measuring angular spectra (reflectivity dependence on the incident angle of monitoring light; green He-Ne laser, 534.5 nm). A deep and sharp waveguide coupling dip was obtained for the PAA/Al multilayer system where the thicknesses of the PAA and Al layers were 200 and 17 nm, respectively. The optical sensor response of the PAA/Al multilayer system was compared to the responses of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor made by a Au thin film on a SF10 glass substrate. It was inferred that the optical waveguide sensor made by the PAA/Al multilayer could detect a smaller change in the refractive index of a solution, and it provided higher resolution than the SPR sensor. The sensor response for a change in the complex refractive index of the PAA layer was examined next, and it was found that the optical waveguide sensor was sensitive to the change in the imaginary part of the complex refractive index rather than the change in the real part. This result indicated that the sensitivity of the optical waveguide sensor could be improved by using the light absorption of a target compound. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

For nearly a century cosmologists have studied the aftermath of this explosion: how the universe expanded and cooled down, and how galaxies were gradually assembled by gravity. The nature of the bang itself has come into focus only relatively recently. It is the subject of the theory of cosmic inflation, which was developed in the last few decades and has led to a radically new global view of the universe. Students and other interested readers will find here a non-technical but conceptually rigorous account of modern cosmological ideas - describing what we know, and how we know it. One of the book's central themes is the scientific quest to find answers to the ultimate cosmic questions: Is the universe finite or infinite? Has it existed forever? If not, when and how did it come into being? Will it ever end? The book is based on the undergraduate course taught by Alex Vilenkin at Tufts University. It assumes no prior knowledge of physics or mathematics beyond elementary high school math. The necessary physics background is introduced as it is required. Each chapter includes a list of questions and exercises of varying degree of difficulty.},

abstract = {This book, written by researchers who had been professionals in accelerator physics before becoming leaders of groups in astroparticle physics, introduces both fields in a balanced and elementary way, requiring only a basic knowledge of quantum mechanics on the part of the reader. The early history of particle physics cannot be distinguished from the history of cosmic rays. With the advent of accelerators, however, the importance of cosmic rays in particle physics was lost. This situation persisted until the 1990s, when novel techniques allowed breakthrough discoveries, and exploration of new physics scales now requires returning to cosmic rays. The new profile of scientists in fundamental physics ideally involves the merging of knowledge in astroparticle and particle physics, but the duration of modern experiments is such that people cannot simultaneously be practitioners in both. Introduction to Particle and Astroparticle Physics is designed to bridge the gap between the fields. It can be used as a self-training book, a consultation book, or a textbook providing a "modern" approach to particles and fundamental interactions.},

abstract = {We present a simplified approach to understanding the mechanics of stable electrospinning jets based on electrohydrodynamic theory that explicitly incorporates the extensional rheology of polymeric fluids. Flow regimes of electrospun jets are identified by analogy to uniaxial extension of a fluid jet. These flow regimes predict the limiting kinematics of electrospinning jets and identify dimensionless parameters important to the control and operation of electrospinning processes. In situ kinematic measurements validate model assumptions and scaling predictions, and allow the reduction of entire jet radius and velocity profiles to several key parameters. The model predictions are shown to hold both above and below the entanglement concentration, as well as for solutions with added electrolyte and increased conductivity. The analysis also enables direct measurement of the apparent extensional viscosity of solutions at the high extension rates experienced during electrospinning. Finally, dimensional analysis of the model yields a correlation for electrospun fiber diameter in terms of measurable fluid properties, controlled process parameters, and measured jet variables, demonstrating the influence of mechanics in the straight portion of the jet on ultimate fiber morphology.},

abstract = {The present article describes the basic physics and some applications of a new technique for structure determination using X-ray absorption. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) on the high energy side of absorption edges contains structure information on the local atomic environment surrounding the absorbing atom. Because EXAFS supplies the local structure about each type of atom in the sample, separately, without requiring crystallinity of the sample, it makes feasible structure measurements in many systems which have defied previous analysis by standard techniques. Some examples of diverse applications of the technique are given such as: characterizing adsorbed surface atoms; studying catalysts; measuring the environment around the metal atom in metalloproteins; determining the structure of liquids, glasses and amorphous solids; and measuring solids under high pressure. The article concludes by pointing out how the intense X-ray sources recently produced by synchrotron radiation have made EXAFS measurements simpler and speedier. {\textcopyright} 1978 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Near-field electrospinning (NFES) had better controllability than conventional electrospinning. However, due to the lack of guidance of theoretical model, precise deposition of micro/nano fibers could only accomplished by experience. To analyze the behavior of charged jet in NFES using mathematical model, the momentum balance equation was simplified and a new expression between jet cross-sectional radius and axial position was derived. Using this new expression and mass conservation equation, expressions for jet cross-sectional radius and velocity were derived in terms of axial position and initial jet acceleration in the form of exponential functions. Based on Slender-body theory and Giesekus model, a quadratic equation for initial jet acceleration was acquired. With the proposed model, it was able to accurately predict the diameter and velocity of polymer fibers in NFES, and mathematical analysis rather than experimental methods could be applied to study the effects of the process parameters in NFES. Moreover, the movement velocity of the collector stage can be regulated by mathematical model rather than experience. Therefore, the model proposed in this paper had important guiding significance to precise deposition of polymer fibers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).},

The electrical conductivity of the nanofibers was measured at different weight fractions of CNTs. It was found that the conductivity increased almost two orders of magnitude upon adding 0.5 wt.{\%} CNTs. The correlation between the extent of graphitization and electrical properties of the composite nanofiber was examined by various structural characterization techniques, and the presence of graphitic regions in pyrolyzed CNT/PAN nanofibers was observed that were not present in pure PAN-derived carbon. The influence of fabrication technique on the ordering of carbon sheets in electrospun nanofibers was examined and a templating effect by CNTs that leads to enhanced graphitization is suggested. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We analyze 17 studies of the use of urban sustainable development indicators (SDI) in developed western countries. The analysis reveals a lack of consensus not only on the conceptual framework and the approach favored, but also on the selection and optimal number of indicators. First, by performing different classifications and categorizations of SDI we identify problems inherent in territorial practices that use SDI. Second, we argue that the lack of consensus in several steps of the creation of SDI stems notably from the ambiguity in the definitions of sustainable development, objectives for the use of such indicators, the selection method and the accessibility of qualitative and quantitative data. Third, based on the reviewed studies, we propose a selection strategy for SDI through which we demonstrate the need to adopt a parsimonious list of SDI covering the sustainable development components and their constituent categories as broadly as possible while minimizing the number of indicators retained.},

abstract = {This textbook introduces readers to the fundamental hardware used in modern computers. The only pre-requisite is algebra, so it can be taken by college freshman or sophomore students or even used in Advanced Placement courses in high school. This book presents both the classical approach to digital system design (i.e., pen and paper) in addition to the modern hardware description language (HDL) design approach (computer-based). This textbook enables readers to design digital systems using the modern HDL approach while ensuring they have a solid foundation of knowledge of the underlying hardware and theory of their designs. This book is designed to match the way the material is actually taught in the classroom. Topics are presented in a manner which builds foundational knowledge before moving onto advanced topics. The author has designed the content with learning goals and assessment at its core. Each section addresses a specific learning outcome that the learner should be able to "do" after its completion. The concept checks and exercise problems provide a rich set of assessment tools to measure learner performance on each outcome. This book can be used for either a sequence of two courses consisting of an introduction to logic circuits (Chapters 1-7) followed by logic design (Chapters 8-13) or a single, accelerated course that uses the early chapters as reference material.},

@article{Munna2019,
abstract = {Liquid Crystals (LCs) are widely used in display devices, electro-optic modulators, and optical switches. A field-induced electrical conductivity modulation in pure liquid crystals is very low which makes it less preferable for direct current (DC) and radio-frequency (RF) switching applications. According to the literature, a conductivity enhancement is possible by nanoparticle doping. Considering this aspect, we reviewed published works focused on an electric field-induced conductivity modulation in carbon nanotube-doped liquid crystal composites (LC-CNT composites). A two to four order of magnitude switching in electrical conductivity is observed by several groups. Both in-plane and out-of-plane device configurations are used. In plane configurations are preferable for micro-device fabrication. In this review article, we discussed published works reporting the elastic and molecular interaction of a carbon nanotube (CNT) with LC molecules, temperature and CNT concentration effects on electrical conductivity, local heating, and phase transition behavior during switching. Reversibility and switching speed are the two most important performance parameters of a switching device. It was found that dual frequency nematic liquid crystals (DFNLC) show a faster switching with a good reversibility, but the switching ratio is only two order of magnitudes. A better way to ensure reversibility with a large switching magnitude is to use two pairs of in-plane electrodes in a cross configuration. For completeness and comparison purposes, we briefly reviewed other nanoparticle- (i.e., Au and Ag) doped LC composite's conductivity behavior as well. Finally, based on the reported works reviewed in this article on field induced conductivity modulation, we proposed a novel idea of RF switching by LC composite materials. To support the idea, we simulated an LC composite-based RF device considering a simple analytical model. Our RF analysis suggests that a device made with an LC-CNT composite could show an acceptable performance. Several technological challenges needed to be addressed for a physical realization and are also discussed briefly.},

abstract = {In many European cities, urban gardens are seen as increasingly important components of urban green space networks. We adopt an ecosystem services framework to assess contributions of urban gardens to the quality of of their users. First, we identify and characterize ecosystem services provided by urban gardens. Secondly, we assess the demographic and socioeconomic profile of its beneficiaries and the relative importance they attribute to different ecosystem services. Next we discuss the relevance of our results in relation to critical policy challenges, such as the promotion of societal cohesion and healthy lifestyles. Data were collected through 44 semi-structured interviews and a survey among 201 users of 27 urban gardens in Barcelona, Spain, as well as from consultation meetings with local planners. We identified 20 ecosystem services, ranging from food production over pollination to social cohesion and environmental learning. Among them, cultural ecosystem services (non-material benefits people derive from their interaction with nature) ​ stand out as the most widely perceived and as the most highly valued. The main beneficiaries of ecosystem services from urban gardens are elder, low-middle income, and migrant people. Our results about the societal importance of urban gardens ​were deemed highly relevant by the interviewed green space planners in Barcelona, who noted that our data can provide basis to support or expand existing gardening programs in the city. Our research further suggests that ecosystem services from urban gardens can play an important role in addressing several urban policy challenges in cities, such as promoting stewardship of urban ecosystems, providing opportunities for recreation and healthy lifestyles, and promoting social cohesion. We conclude that urban gardens and associated ecosystem services can play an important ​ in urban policies aimed at enhancing quality of life in cities, particularly if access to their benefits is expanded to larger segments of the population.},

abstract = {Advances a critical thinking perspective on economics, emphasizing the limits of simplifying assumptions International perspective in its treatment of economic institutions and in the choice of policy issues Integrates new developments, e.g. greater influence of game theory, treatment of institutional and behavioral factors Places economics within a larger, interdisciplinary context by calling attention to the subject's boundaries with other social sciences, natural sciences, history and philosophy Detailed explanation to allow instructors to shift classroom time away from lecturing and toward workshops, research projects and other active learning methods The world has changed dramatically in recent years and so has the field of economics, but many introductory economics textbooks have remained stuck in the past. This book provides a new beginning for the study of microeconomics, emphasizing current debates and research trends. It is international in outlook and reflects the shift toward empirical methods, as well as the study of institutions and economic behavior. It is also written to fit in with an approach to teaching based on active learning and critical thinking. Mainstream material is still covered, but within a new context, making it more relevant, realistic and responsive to the deeper questions economists are now asking about theory and policy. Economics as a discipline is viewed from a broad perspective that takes into account new developments at the intersections with psychology, political science, the natural sciences and philosophy. Economics as presented in this text is less sure that it has all the answers, but it is more interesting, application-oriented and open to new ideas.},

Shape-stabilized, phase change nanofibers have many potential applications as they are able to absorb, hold, and release large amounts of thermal energy over a certain temperature range by taking advantage of the large heat of fusion of long-chain hydrocarbons. We have focused on compounds with melting points near room temperature (octadecane) and body temperature (eicosane) as these temperature ranges are most valuable in practice. We have produced thermally stable, phase change materials up to 45 wt {\%} octadecane, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry.

Designed by researchers at US National Laboratories to support a new generation of high performance buildings, EnergyPlus and OpenStudio are revolutionizing how building energy modeling is taught in universities and applied by professional architects and engineers around the world. The authors, all researchers at National Renewable Energy Laboratory and members of the OpenStudio software development team, present modeling concepts using open source software that may be generally applied using a variety of software tools commonly used by design professionals. The book also discusses modeling process automation in the context of OpenStudio Measures—small self-contained scripts that can transform energy models and their data—to save time and effort. They illustrate key concepts through a sophisticated example problem that evolves in complexity throughout the book. The text also examines advanced topics including daylighting, parametric analysis, uncertainty analysis, design optimization, and model calibration. Building Energy Modeling with OpenStudio teaches students to become sophisticated modelers rather than simply proficient software users. It supports undergraduate and graduate building energy courses in Architecture, and in Mechanical, Civil, Architectural, and Sustainability Engineering.},

abstract = {Primarily is important to make awareness on the large quantities of agricultural/food waste that is lost every year, minute and second around the world. It estimates that each year, approximately one-third food produced for human consumption in the world is lost or wasted. The global volume of food wastage is estimated to be 1.6 Gtonnes of “primary product equivalents”, while the total wastage for the edible part of food is 1.3 Gtonnes. This amount can be weighed against total agricultural production (for food and non-food uses), which is about 6 Gtonnes.1 Without accounting for GHG emissions from land use change, the carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated to 3.3 Gtonnes of CO2 equivalent: as such, food wastage ranks as the third top emitter after USA and China. Globally, the blue water footprint (i.e. the consumption of surface and groundwater resources) of food wastage is about 250km, which is equivalent to the annual water discharge of the Volga river, or three times the volume of Lake Geneva. With such situations, it seems clear that a reduction of food wastage at global, regional, and national scales would have a substantial positive effect on natural and societal resources. Food wastage reduction would not only avoid pressure on scarce natural resources but also decrease the need to raise food production by 60 percent to meet the 2050 population demand.1 Fortunately, different kinds of methods have been proposed for reuse agricultural waste instead of remain in the environment. These residues occurred by processing, production and harvest of cereal products, fruits, vegetables and trees, and through stock farming. They are produced in large amounts worldwide and either burnt in the field or used as animal feed.2 Agricultural residues are lignocellulosic materials.3 Therefore, these wastes are used on production of industrial products such as organic acids, biofuels, protein enriched feed, aroma compounds, bioactive secondary metabolites, microbial pigments, mushroom and enzymes as substrate.4},

@article{MalvernInstrumentsWorldwide2016,
abstract = {Shear flow can be depicted as layers of fluid sliding over one another with each layer moving faster than the one beneath it. The uppermost layer has maximum velocity while the bottom layer is stationary. For shear flow to take place a shear force must act on the fluid. This external force takes the form of a shear stress ($\sigma$) which is defined as the force (F) acting over a unit area (A) as shown in Figure 1. In response to this force the upper layer will move a given distance x, while the bottom layer remains stationary. Hence we have a displacement gradient across the sample (x/h) termed the shear strain ($\gamma$). For a solid which behaves like a single block of material, the strain will be finite for an applied stress-no flow is possible. However, for a fluid where the constituent components can move relative to one another, the shear strain will continue to increase for the period of applied stress. This creates a velocity gradient termed the shear rate or strain rate () which is the rate of change of strain with time (d$\gamma$/dt). Figure 1-Quantification of shear rate and shear stress for layers of fluid sliding over one another When we apply a shear stress to a fluid we are transferring momentum, indeed the shear stress is equivalent to the momentum flux or rate of momentum transfer to the upper layer of fluid. That momentum is transferred through the layers of fluid by collisions and interactions with other fluid components giving a reduction in fluid velocity and kinetic energy. The coefficient of proportionality between the shear stress and shear rate is defined as the shear viscosity or dynamic viscosity ($\eta$), which is a quantitative measure of the internal fluid friction and associated with damping or loss of kinetic energy in the system. Newtonian fluids are fluids in which the shear stress is linearly related to the shear rate and hence the viscosity is invariable with shear rate or shear stress. Typical Newtonian fluids include water, simple hydrocarbons and dilute colloidal dispersions. Non-Newtonian fluids are those where the viscosity varies as a function of the applied shear rate or shear stress. It should be noted that fluid viscosity is both pressure and temperature dependent, with viscosity generally increasing with increased pressure and decreasing temperature. Temperature is more critical than pressure in this regard with higher viscosity fluids such as asphalt or bitumen much more temperature dependent than low viscosity fluids such as water. To measure shear viscosity using a single head (stress controlled) rotational rheometer with parallel plate measuring systems, the sample is loaded between the plates at a known gap (h) as shown in Figure 2. Single head rheometers are capable of working in controlled stress or controlled rate mode which means it is},

The phenomena responsible for the onset of whipping are revealed by a linear instability analysis that describes the jet behavior in terms of known fluid properties and operating conditions. The behavior of two competing instabilities, the Rayleigh mode and the axisymmetric conducting mode, is also described. The results are summarized using operating diagrams, delineating regimes of operation in electrospinning, which are in good agreement with experimental observations.},

abstract = {RHEOLOGY AND VISCOSITY MICRORHEOLOGY Polymers are versatile materials that play an important role in a diverse range of industrial applications. Polymeric solutions or suspensions provide joint lubrication in the human body, make foods appear rich and creamy, and impart stability to inks and paints. In these and many other applications the rheological characteristics of the polymer solution have a defining influence on product performance and functionality. Rheology is the study of material deformation and flow, and it can be used to establish a direct link between polymer characteristics -such as molecular weight (MW), molecular size and structure -and product performance. Working towards rheological targets defined in terms of viscosity or viscoelasticity to achieve performance targets is an efficient formulation strategy but relies on measuring relevant rheological data 1 . This whitepaper examines the key rheological characteristics of polymer solutions and the techniques that are available to measure them. These include rotational and microfluidic rheometry and microrheology. Case studies illustrate the data that can be generated and its potential application. Understanding the role of rheology in formulation Formulators apply two complementary strategies when working towards defined product performance targets. The first is to change the composition of the formulation; the second is to alter the physical characteristics of the ingredients. In the specific case of formulations incorporating polymers the two most commonly manipulated variables are polymer concentration (composition) and MW (a physical characteristic of the polymer). However, there are a number of other factors that can also impact how polymer solutions behave. These include polymer structure and type, temperature, polymer charge and solvent quality. Traditionally, formulation has been an empirical process based on making changes to the formulation and measuring aspects of product performance to determine the resulting impact. This can be a lengthy procedure and provides little insight into why a change is associated with an observed effect. Consider the example of experimenting with different grades of a polymeric food additive to achieve a sauce that has an appearance and mouth feel that is appealing to consumers. The tests required to assess both mouth feel and appearance may be time-consuming, and somewhat subjective, and the results may be difficult to correlate with measurable differences in},

abstract = {Nanofibers are an important class of material that is useful in a variety of applications, including filtration, tissue engineering, protective clothing, battery separators, energy storage, etc. So far, electrospinning is the most used method for producing nanofibers. However, the wide-spread commercial use of electrospinning is limited mainly due to its low production rate. Most other nanofiber production methods, such as melt-blowing, bicomponent fiber spinning, phase separation, template synthesis, and self-assembly, are complex and can only be used to make nanofibers from limited types of polymers. Centrifugal spinning is an alternative method for producing nanofibers from various materials at high speed and low cost. In centrifugal spinning, the spinning fluid is placed in a rotating spinning head. When the rotating speed reaches a critical value, the centrifugal force overcomes the surface tension of the spinning fluid to eject a liquid jet from the nozzle tip of the spinning head. The jet then undergoes a stretching process and is eventually deposited on the collector, forming solidified nanofibers. Centrifugal spinning is simple and enables the rapid fabrication of nanofibers for various applications. This article gives an overview on the centrifugal spinning process, and compares it with conventional nanofiber production methods. {\textcopyright} 2014 Copyright {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Between the growing numbers of children and adolescents playing sports and the increased attention paid to head injuries by the larger sports community and the general public, pediatric concussions are emerging as a major concern. And as practitioners are seeing more young clients with head injuries, questions arise about age-appropriate assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and return to activity. Pediatric and Adolescent Concussion: Diagnosis, Management, and Outcomes offers evidence-based guidelines where few previously existed. This comprehensive volume clearly explains the effects of traumatic injury on the developing brain in sports- and non-sports-related contexts, and establishes a framework for immediate and long-term management, especially the crucial first 24 hours. Chapters provide a basic grounding in its subject with a history of concussion as a medical entity and a review of definitional and classification issues, take the reader through the steps of a neuropsychological evaluation, pintpoint post-injury issues, and offer strategies for the prevention of further or future injury. Up-to-date information across professional fields ensures this volume of well-rounded coverage of complex factors from injury to recovery. Pediatric and Adolescent Concussion: Diagnosis, Management, and Outcomes serves as both an educational resource and practical framework for a wide array of professionsals, including neuropsychologists, sports medicine physicians, child psychologists and psychiatrists, pediatric and family physicians, athletic trainers, social workers, and educators.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

Before the onset of electrospinning, a bias voltage is applied to a semispherical shaped polymer droplet outside of a syringe needle, and a probe tip mechanically draws a single fiber from the droplet to initiate continuous NFES. Contrary to the conventional electrospinning process, we show that decreasing electrical field in continuous NFES results in smaller linewidth deposition, and nanofibers can be assembled into controlled complex patterns such as circular shapes and grid arrays on large and flat areas. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A brief historical review of four series of commercially available block polymer surface-active agents-the PLURONICR, TETRONICR, PLURADOTR, and PLURONICR R polyols-is presented. A comparison is made of the physical properties within each series, in the form of trend lines. These parameters encompass solubility, rate of solubility, wetting, foaming, defoaming, emulsification, thickening, cleansing, and toxicity. The physical property relationships which depend upon variation in the hydrophobe molecular weight and variation in the hydrophile hydrophobe balance are shown to be similar in each series of surfactants. Differences among the four series of polymers, where they exist, are seen to vary from little to significant. The many controversial articles on the micellar nature of the block polymers and their critical micelle concentrations are examined. Considerations of the important physical properties which lead to practical applications are discussed. Some of the more important newly developed potential uses of these polymeric surfactants are then described in various application areas, including the cosmetic, medical, paper, pharmaceutical, and textile industries. {\textcopyright} 1977 The American Oil Chemists' Society.},

Working through these cases illuminates both the practical and philosophical challenges presented by the moral problems that surface in contemporary end-of-life care. Each case involved real people, with varying goals and constraints,who tried to make the best decisions possible under demanding conditions. Though there were no easy solutions, nor ones that satisfied all stakeholders, there are important lessons to be learned about the ways end-of-life care can continue to improve.

Bradycardia (slow heart beat) is arbitrarily defined as any heart rate {\textless}60 bpm, and tachycardia (fast heart beat) as any rate {\textgreater}100 bpm. Disturbances of cardiac impulse formation and/or transmission comprise the principal mechanisms causing abnormalities of heart rhythm. In basic terms, these are classified as being either brady- or tachy-arrhythmias. The primary goals for treatment of arrhythmias are: (1) to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life and; (2) to prolong patient survival. Pharmacologic treatment has been the mainstay for management of most cardiac arrhythmias, although implantable devices and ablation have become increasingly important. In recent years, nonpharmacologic therapy has begun to play an increasingly important role in curing many arrhythmias (catheter ablation) and preventing their life-threatening consequences (implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy for both primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death). {\textcopyright} 2009 Humana Press.},

Recently we established the formation of porous alumina on solid substrates such as Si, and found a formation of an ordered aluminum hexagonal dot array after finishing of anodic oxidation on a SiO2 substrate. We investigated AFM nanoindentation to control the initial position of nanoholes during anodic oxidation, in order to realize nanoholes and dots with various sizes and densities. Arrays of nanoholes with a nearest neighbor distance from 50 to 120 nm were successfully formed. Al dot tetragonal and hexagonal arrays were formed after selective wet chemical etching of porous alumina film. Electron transport through Al nanodots array at low temperature exhibited a non-linear characteristic with a suppression of current around zero bias, which strongly suggests existence of Coulomb blockade. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

An insight into the process of electrospinning of the polymer, poly(caprolactone) was systematically evaluated and discussed the effects of the solution parameter of concentration of the polymer solution and process parameters of voltage, flow rate and drop height to fabricate poly(caprolactone) electrospun fibers with desired morphologies in this manuscript. Of all combinations, the best nanofibres with the fewest beads and finest fibers could be electrospun with a more uniform distribution in with a 15 kV applied voltage of on poly(caprolactone) solution of 12 per cent concentration at a 0.5 ml/h flow rate, from a drop height of 15 cm and the structure of nanofibres was found completely dry and stabilized.},

abstract = {Optical detection systems for portable analytical instrument require commercially available, miniaturized, robust and well performing light sources. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) have been extensively used in portable analytical devices as they are exceptionally stable light sources offering a number of advantages over traditional light sources including robustness, small size and low-cost. In the analytically more significant deep UV spectral range, LEDs suffer from low optical power and parasitic emissions in the visible wavelength range. Recently, newly developed deep UV-LEDs based on aluminium nitride (AlN) substrates have been introduced claiming improved performance, however there is little in terms of systematic evaluation of their performance parameters when used as light sources in chemical sciences. The aim of this work was to investigate the performance of these new generation deep UV‐LEDs, and assess their analytical applicability. Three AlN substrate based LEDs (OPTAN255H, OPTAN255J and OPTAN280J) were selected based on their maximum emission wavelength and maximum optical power. Their emission spectra, optical output power values and energy conversion efficiency (electrical/optical) were investigated. This work shows effects of forward current and voltages on the ratio of intensities of the visible parasitic emission to the desirable deep UV emission. Experimental results show that while the parasitic emission still exists with the new generation deep UV-LEDs, with increasing forward current the ratio of undesirable parasitic emission to the main deep UV emission rapidly decreased to values as low as 0.1{\%} at the maximum forward current (100 mA). The new generation deep UV-LED (255 nm) was then applied as a light source for a photometric on-capillary detection, showing excellent linearity with stray light down to 0.8{\%}, and effective pathlength above 92{\%} of the used capillary inner diameter, and finally the performance was demonstrated by detection of four parabens separated by miniaturised capillary liquid chromatography.},

abstract = {We discuss various scattering mechanisms for Dirac fermions in single-layer graphene. It is shown that scattering on a short-range potential (e.g. due to neutral impurities) is mostly irrelevant for electronic quality of graphene, which is likely to be controlled by charged impurities and ripples (microscopic corrugations of a graphene sheet). The latter are an inherent feature of graphene due to its two-dimensional nature and can also be an important factor in defining the electron mean-free path. We show that certain types of ripples create a long-range scattering potential, similar to Coulomb scatterers, and result in charge-carrier mobility practically independent of carrier concentration, in agreement with experimental observations. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

@book{Middleton2007,
abstract = {Acquired brain injury in childhood is not uncommon and arises from trauma, metabolic conditions, CNS tumours and infection, toxins or as a result of treatment. Injury to the brain can occur any time from just after conception onwards. Age of injury is a critical variable in determining outcome, as is the mechanism of injury. When the brain is in a period of rapid growth, injury can have greater effects than when the brain and associated functioning have slowed or are fully developed. Injury in younger children generally leads to greater and more global deficits, with evidence of some functional reorganization, but only when injury is focal. Some functional outcomes emerge with age, often years after injury. Apart from functional problems, social, educational and self-image difficulties can arise from physical impairments. In addition, there can be cognitive problems with speed of processing, attention, memory, language and communication, visual perception and executive skills. Few children have problems in all these domains. Effects can be cumulative and interact. Frequently there are behavioural and emotional sequelae, such as disinhibition, impulsiveness, depression and anxiety, often more difficult for parents to cope with than physical or cognitive problems. Difficulties can arise directly from the child's reaction to the injury and sequelae, parental management and education's failure to meet special needs. The effect on the family can be considerable, and after initial involvement from health and education, families find help and support decreases with time. Thorough assessment is the first step in a range of psychological interventions. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The electrical conductivity of different carbon materials (multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon black and graphite), widely used as fillers in polymeric matrices, was studied using compacts produced by a paper preparation process and by powder compression. Powder pressing assays show that the bulk conductivity depends not only on the intrinsic material properties but is also strongly affected by the number of particle contacts and the packing density. Conductivities at high pressure (5MPa) for the graphene, nanotube and carbon black show lower values ({\~{}}10 2S/m) as compared to graphite ({\~{}}10 3S/m). For nanotube, graphene and graphite particles, the conductive behavior during compaction is governed by mechanical particle arrangement/deformation mechanisms while for carbon black this behavior is mainly governed by the increasing particle contact area. The materials resulting from the paper preparation process for carbon black and graphite showed similar conductivity values as for the compacts, indicating a limited effect of the surfactant on the conductivity. The paper preparation process for the large surface area nanotube and graphene particles induces a highly preferred in-plane orientation, thereby yielding largely the single particle intrinsic conductivity for the in-plane direction, with values in the order of 10 3S/m. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Unit I discusses the unique mechanisms of water and ion transport, while Unit II describes the various metabolic events essential for plant development that result from plants' ability to capture photons from sunlight, to convert inorganic forms of nutrition to organic forms and to synthesize high energy molecules, such as ATP. Light signal perception and transduction works in perfect coordination with a wide variety of plant growth regulators in regulating various plant developmental processes, and these aspects are explored in Unit III. Unit IV investigates plants' various structural and biochemical adaptive mechanisms to enable them to survive under a wide variety of abiotic stress conditions (salt, temperature, flooding, drought), pathogen and herbivore attack (biotic interactions). Lastly, Unit V addresses the large number of secondary metabolites produced by plants that are medicinally important for mankind and their applications in biotechnology and agriculture.

abstract = {Ultrafine fibers were spun from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) solution in N,N‐dimethylformamide using a homemade electrospinning setup. Fibers with diameter ranging from 80 to 340 nm were obtained. Fiber size and fiber size distribution were investigated for various concentration, applied voltage, and tip‐to‐collector distance using image analysis. The diameters of the electrospun fibers increase when increasing the solution concentration and decrease slightly when increasing the voltage and needle tip‐to‐collector distance. Porosity and air permeability are vital properties in applications of electrospun nanofibrous structures. In this study, effects of process parameters on the porosity and air permeability of electrospun nanoweb were investigated as well. Results of statistical analysis showed that solution concentration and applied voltage have significant influences on pore diameters. It was concluded that nanofiber diameter played an important role on the diameter of pores formed by the intersections of nanofibers. A more realistic understanding of porosity was obtained and a quantitative relationship between nanoweb parameters and its air permeability was established by regression analysis. Two separate models were constructed for predicting air permeability in relation to process parameters. Optimization of electrospinning process for producing nanoweb with desirable air permeability is well achieved by these models. The models presented in this study are of high importance for their ability to predict the air permeability of PAN nanoweb both by process or structure parameters. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {The solubility of stearic acid, ranitidine hydrochloride, and stavudine were predicted in selected organic solvents. The experimental solubility data of stearic acid and ranitidine hydrochloride were reported in previous work of the authors and stavudine's solubility was measured in this work. Equilibrium aqueous solubility of crystalline stauvudine was determined at controlled temperatures by stirring and filtration, with spectrophotometric quantification. The new model developed in Part 11 of this communication was modified as a semipredictive model with two adjustable parameters. Predicting the solubility data with the NRTL model using just one experimental point resulted in a big error while the modified new model and the UNIQUAC model showed much smaller errors. A new method was proposed in this work for predicting the solubility data of all polymorphs of a given compound using the experimental solubility data of one of the polymorphs of the same chemical compound. Although in general, the UNIQUAC model predictions were marginally superior, the new model is simpler and does not require the molecular parameters such as Van der Waals area and volume. The solubility prediction in a mixture of solvents using the NRTL and UNIQUAC models was also discussed.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991 by Iijima, they have been of great interest, both from a fundamental point of view and for future applications. The eye-catching features of these structures are their electronic, mechanical, optical and chemical characteristics, which open a way to future applications. These properties can even be measured on single nanotubes. For commercial application, large quantities of purified nanotubes are needed. Different types of carbon nanotubes can be produced in various ways. The most common techniques used nowadays are: arc discharge, laser ablation and chemical vapour deposition. Purification of the tubes can be divided into a couple of main techniques: oxidation, acid treatment, annealing, sonication, filtering and functionalisation techniques. Economically feasible large-scale production and purification techniques still have to be developed. Fundamental and practical nanotube researches have shown possible applications in various fields. Real applications are still under development. This report provides an overview of current nanotube technology, with a special focus on synthesis and purification, properties, benefits and applications.},

abstract = {Emphasis is on a broad description of the general methods and processes for the synthesis, modification and characterization of macromolecules. These more fundamental chapters will be supplemented by selected and detailed experiments. In addition to the preparative aspects the book also gives the reader an impression on the relation of chemical constitution and morphology of Polymers to their properties, as well as on their application areas. Thus, an additional textbook will not be needed in order to understand the experiments. The 5th edition contains numerous changes: In recent years, so-called functional polymers which have special electrical, electronic, optical and biological properties, have gained more and more in interest. This textbook was therefore supplemented by recipes which describe the synthesis of these materials in a new chapter "Functional polymers". Together with new experiments in chapter 3,4 and 5 the book now contains more than 120 recipes that describe a wide range of macromolecules. From the reviews of recent editions: "This is an excellent book for all polymer chemists engaged in synthesis research studies and education. It is educationally sound and has excellent laboratory synthetic examples. The fundamentals are well done for the teaching of students and references are resonably up-to-date. As in previous issues, there are sections dealing with an introduction; structure and nomenclature; methods and techniques for synthesis, characterization, processing and modification of polymers{\ldots}..The authors have noted the following changes from previous editions- a new section on correlations of structure, morphology and properties; revision and enlargement of other property and characterization procedures; additional new experiments such as controlled radical polymerization; enzymatic polymerizations; microelmulsions; and electrical conducting polymers. This is a high quality textbook at a reasonable price and should be considered as a suitable reference for all engaged in synthetic areas of polymer research." (Eli M.

abstract = {The present work, reports on combination of precise positioning ability of 3D printers with near field electro spinning (NFES) as a low-cost and scalable approach to generate well-aligned, evenly distributed microfiber mask upon flexible substrates coated with metal thin film. Using a combination of annealing thermal treatment and the wet chemical etching of metal layer a flexible transparent electrode is prepared. Using this high speed and large-area printing technique we can overcome the drawbacks of conventional electrospinning such as fiber structural inhomogeneity, random orientation, and non-reproducible results. In addition, the application of more complicated and expensive methods such as lithography or e-beam lithography or nanoimprint lithography can be avoided using this technique. The most important advantage of the reported fabrication method relative to electro-spinning process is the ability to have a special control on the distribution pattern of the electrodes on the surface which can lead to better control over the ratio of conductivity and transparency of the surface.},

abstract = {Melt electrospinning (MES) was used to prepare fast dissolving fibrous drug delivery systems in the presence of plasticizers. This new method was found promising in the field of pharmaceutical formulation because it combines the advantages of melt extrusion and solvent-based electrospinning. Lowering of the process temperature was performed using plasticizers in order to avoid undesired thermal degradation. Carvedilol (CAR), a poorly water-soluble and thermal-sensitive model drug, was introduced into an amorphous methacrylate terpolymer matrix, Eudragit{\textregistered} E, suitable for fiber formation. Three plasticizers (triacetin, Tween{\textregistered} 80, and polyethylene glycol 1500) were tested, all of which lowered the process temperature effectively. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and Raman microspectrometry investigations showed that crystalline CAR turned into an amorphous form during processing and preserved it for longer time. In vitro dissolution studies revealed ultrafast drug dissolution of the fibrous samples. According to the HPLC impurity tests, the reduced stability of CAR under conditions applied without plasticizer could be avoided using plasticizers, whereas storage tests also indicated the importance of optimizing the process parameters during MES. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.},

However, building the third dimension with NFES is not easy due to the unsolidified fibre while being deposited. Presented in this paper is an investigation on the influence of process parameters on achieving a small cylindrical fibre from the near-field fibre deposition of an electrospinning-based rapid prototyping. A set of experiments have been conducted on solutions of polycaprolactone (PCL) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Parameters of interest are voltage, standoff distance, polymer concentration, environmental condition and needle size. From the experimental results, polymer concentration, environmental condition and needle size had influence on achieving a small cylindrical fibre. Under near-field deposition, the concentration should be high, the needle should be small and the temperature should be maintained during the process.},

Nitrogen doping at N:Ti 1:1 atomic ratio has been proposed in order to decrease the intrinsic resistance of TiO2, thus enabling better signal to noise ratio of the electrical response. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The presence of oxygen during the carbonization process is detrimental to the production of biochar yield and properties. The experiment was carried out on several wood species in a fixed-bed pyrolyser under various fractions of oxygen ranging from 0{\%} to 11{\%} by varying nitrogen and oxygen composition in the pyrolysing gas mixtures at desired compositions. The bed temperature and holding time were also varied. Process optimization was carried out by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) by employing Central Composite Design (CCD) using Design Expert 6.0 Software. The effect of oxygen ratio and holding time on biochar yield within the range studied were statistically significant. From the analysis result, optimum condition of 15.2{\%} biochar yield of mangrove wood was predicted at pyrolysis temperature of 403 oC, oxygen percentage of 2.3{\%} and holding time of two hours. This prediction agreed well with the experiment finding of 15.1{\%} biochar yield. Keywords—Mangrove},

abstract = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the "dust bowl" era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4-1.0 m if 21st century CO(2) concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6-1.9 m for peak CO(2) concentrations exceeding approximately 1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

abstract = {Complicated microscale patterns of a continuous nanofiber were precisely fabricated via direct-write near-field electrospinning (NFES). Although NFES could eliminate the bending instability effect by shortening tip-to-collector distance (TTCD) less than the critical length, reported patterns up to the date have been limited to simply aligned straight-lines because of the ignorance of the importance of jet impact speed. To realize the jet impact speed for precise microscale patterning, experimental study of the effect of the process parameters such as applied voltage, TTCD, and an electric field was performed. It has been found that lowering the applied voltage and the TTCD simultaneously could reduce the jet impact speed while keeping the process stable and continuous, resulting in considerable improvement of the accuracy of the deposition. Having the ability to control jet impact speed in NFES will provide the essential foundation to broaden applications of NFES to micro and nanoscale engineering such as an optical waveguide, customized cell culture matrix fabrication to name a few.},

@article{Coppola2014,
abstract = {A lthough electrospinning (ES) allows the production of unsurpassed nanoscale polymer fibers, the major drawbacks are the nozzle-clogging and single-jet spinneret, respectively. This is a real limitation in terms of usable polymers and for patterning active organics. Nowadays the micro-engineering of smart materials could represent a new route for many fields of technology ranging from the production of electronic and photonic devices 1−3 to regener-ative medicine and tissue engineering. 4−7 An enormous technological interest is related to the possibility of patterning fibers directly in well-ordered patterns avoiding the deposition of nonwoven submicrometer mats often occurring in ES. 8,9 In the past decade several attempts have been made using field-induced 10−13 and near-field ES, 14,15 but only very recently, with the introduction of mechano ES, 16 has the production of well-ordered fiber patterns been achieved. Nevertheless, some drawbacks related to the complexity of the setup, the operating temperature, and the selection of usable materials for problems related to nozzle clogging still persist. Moreover, high temperature can cause deterioration of the optical and electronic properties of active organic materials eventually embedded in the functionalized fibers. On the other side, interfering effects due to closeness of multiple electrified nozzles ban working with multiple spinnerets. Here we introduce a revolutionary nozzle-free approach, the tethered pyro-electrodynamic spinning (TPES) operating in wireless modality, i.e., without electric circuit, electrodes, and voltage supply. This novel approach definitively simplifies the ES apparatus extending the nanofiber spinning also to active organic polymers preserving at the same time all the properties of conventional systems. Fiber drawing from the liquid polymer is driven through the pyroelectric charge generated into a ferroelectric crystal (i.e., LiNbO 3) able to induce the electro-hydrodynamics (EHD) pressure required for polymer manipulation without wires. The approach is highly flexible, simple, compact, and cost-effective when compared with classical ES, and last but not least, it allows working safely, avoiding the use of high-voltage equipment at kVolts scale. For the first time, in situ observation of fiber drawing is provided allowing real-time adjustments and full control of the process. Moreover the TPES adds to the capabilities of conventional ES the chance of printing polymer fibers even in the case of multiple drops opening the way to the multijetting spinneret modality for multiplexing and speeding up the fabrication process. Printing of micro-and nanofibers directly from a polymer drop with unprecedented order, direct writing of sharp/straight edges, and easy multijets electrospinning are demonstrated and reported. Experimental fabrication of patterns embedded with active molecules ensures that functionalized patterns preserve their functionalities after the TPES process. Results regarding the use of smart patterns for keeping alive and viable cultured cells are discussed. This study opens the way to innovative optogenesys analysis, guiding light for generating or transporting optical/electronic signals from and to cells. 17−21 The setup proposed in this work, unlike the conventional ES, is electrode-free and nozzle-free, Figure 1a,b. The method allows polymer nanofibers to be printed directly from a polymer drop overpassing the viscosity border of nozzle clogging in conventional inkjet systems. 22 The drop reservoir is placed directly on a flat substrate (base) while an electric field, Figure 1.

abstract = {This paper demonstrates for the first time localized chemical vapor deposition of WO3-x on a suspended glassy carbon wire. A process based on the photopatterning of an SU-8 scaffold, the near-field electrospinning of an SU-8 fiber, and their pyrolysis yields a monolithic carbon structure featuring a glassy carbon wire of known diameter and length, suspended on a glassy carbon scaffold. The temperature required for the deposition of WO3-x is generated by passing current through the wire, which causes Joule heating. The deposition starts in the midpoint of the wire, and extends to its ends as the current is increased. The thickness and length of the coating are functions of the imposed current. The evolution of the coating can be monitored in real time by measuring the voltage vs current characteristic of the wire. We have deposited WO3-x coatings with thickness from 71 nm to 1.4 $\mu$m, in glassy carbon wires with diameters between 780 nm and 2.95 $\mu$m. The coatings are uniform and polycrystalline. The suspended glassy carbon wire is a generic platform for the deposition of many transition metal oxide (TMO) coatings, and opens the door to carbon-TMO structures for applications including catalysis and gas sensing.},

abstract = {In this paper, we uncover a new method for the preparation of biopolymer scaffolds and demonstrate its potential for the development of organs with the aid of tissue engineering. Two novel nanocomposite polymers, a nonbiodegradable polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane-poly (carbonate-urea)urethane and a biodegradable polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane-polycaprolactone-poly(carbonate-urea)urethane, have been subjected to flow in an electric field. Electrically forced microthreading of the polymers occurs and a three-dimensional print-patterning device was used to deposit fine (50 µm) threads of polymer according to a predesigned architecture to prepare scaffolds. The technique can offer tremendous potential in the development of organs.},

abstract = {For large area micro/nano pattern printing, multi-nozzle electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing setup is an efficient method to boost productivity in near-field electrospinning (NFES) process. And controlling EHD multi-jet accurate deposition under the interaction of nozzles and other parameters are crucial concerns during the process. The influence and sensitivity of various parameters such as the needle length, needle spacing, electrode-to-collector distance, voltage etc. on the direct-write patterning performance was investigated by orthogonal experiments with dual-nozzle NFES setup, and then the deposition distance estimated based on a novel model was compared with measurement results and proven. More controllable deposition distance and much denser of aligned naofiber can be achieved by rotating the dual-nozzle setup. This study can be greatly contributed to estimate the deposition distance and helpful to guide the multi-nozzle NFES process to accurate direct-write pattern in manufacturing process in future.},

abstract = {Agriculture, through its economic, social and ecological functions, presents potentials for meeting some of the targets of the 11th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). The targets include: a) reducing the adverse environmental impact of cities (target 11.6), b) providing access to green spaces (target 11.7) and c) promoting resource-use efficiency in cities (target 11b). Nevertheless, cities, especially those in the global south, are struggling to sustain agriculture due to rapid and uncontrolled urbanisation. How to maintain (peri-) urban agriculture in cities and their peripheries in an era of increasing land scarcity is unclear in the conventional literature. In this regard, this study set out to determine appropriate practices globally that can foster the sustenance of urban and peri-urban agriculture and determine their applicability to the Ghanaian context. Even though Ghana remains the focus of the discussion, the generality of the characteristics of the cities in Sub-Saharan Africa makes the practices useful to Sub-Saharan African region. The study obtained the required data, through a review of literature, from databases such as Scopus, PubMed, MeSH and ProQuest. The authors complemented the literature from these conventional sources with literature from grey sources such as institutional websites and online media publications. The results of the literature review show that container gardening, backyard gardening, and farming on vacant lands and marginal lands can hold the key to preserving agriculture within the cities. However, these models are more appropriate for the production of vegetables and herbs. Therefore, urban and peri-urban agriculture may concentrate on the production of herbs and vegetables, to complement the food supply from rural agriculture. The Purchase of Development Right and expropriation and zoning of peri-urban land for agricultural purposes appear to be important strategies for promoting access to land for peri-urban agriculture. The strategies call for revisions of city legislation and the land use planning process to legitimise and promote agriculture in cities and their peripheries.},

In C-MEMS, photoresist is patterned by photolithography and subsequently pyrolyzed at high-temperatures in an oxygen-free environment. We established that it is possible to use C-MEMS to create very high-aspect ratio carbon structures (e.g. posts with an aspect ratio {\textgreater}10), suspended carbon plates and suspended carbon nanowires (C-NEMS). By changing the lithography conditions, soft and hard baking times and temperatures, additives to the resist, pyrolysis time, temperature and environment, C-MEMS permits a wide variety of interesting new MEMS and NEMS applications that employ structures having a wide variety of shapes, resistivities and mechanical properties. We also demonstrate that arrays of high-aspect ratio carbon posts can be charged/discharged with Li and this enables the fabrication of a smart switchable array of batteries. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Driven by applications in chemical sensing, biological imaging and material characterisation, Raman spectroscopies are attracting growing interest from a variety of scientific disciplines. The Raman effect originates from the inelastic scattering of light, and it can directly probe vibration/rotational-vibration states in molecules and materials. Despite numerous advantages over infrared spectroscopy, spontaneous Raman scattering is very weak, and consequently, a variety of enhanced Raman spectroscopic techniques have emerged. These techniques include stimulated Raman scattering and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, as well as surface- and tip-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopies. The present review provides the reader with an understanding of the fundamental physics that govern the Raman effect and its advantages, limitations and applications. The review also highlights the key experimental considerations for implementing the main experimental Raman spectroscopic techniques. The relevant data analysis methods and some of the most recent advances related to the Raman effect are finally presented. This review constitutes a practical introduction to the science of Raman spectroscopy; it also highlights recent and promising directions of future research developments.},

Mullins and others have suggested that the difference between surface tension and surface energy cannot be sustained and that the two will approach each other over time. In this work we show that in a single-component system where changes in elastic energy can be neglected, the chemical potential difference between the surface and bulk is proportional to the difference between surface tension and surface energy. By further assuming that mass transfer is driven by this chemical potential difference, we establish a model for the kinetics by which mass transfer removes the difference between surface tension and surface energy. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been attracting tremendous attention owing to their structure (chirality) dependent outstanding properties, which endow them with great potential in a wide range of applications. The preparation of chirality-pure SWCNTs is not only a great scientific challenge but also a crucial requirement for many high-end applications. As such, research activities in this area over the last two decades have been very extensive. In this review, we summarize recent achievements and accumulated knowledge thus far and discuss future developments and remaining challenges from three aspects: controlled growth, postsynthesis sorting, and characterization techniques. In the growth part, we focus on the mechanism of chirality-controlled growth and catalyst design. In the sorting part, we organize and analyze existing literature based on sorting targets rather than methods. Since chirality assignment and quantification is essential in the study of selective preparation, we also include in the last part a comprehensive description and discussion of characterization techniques for SWCNTs. It is our view that even though progress made in this area is impressive, more efforts are still needed to develop both methodologies for preparing ultrapure (e.g., {\textgreater}99.99{\%}) SWCNTs in large quantity and nondestructive fast characterization techniques with high spatial resolution for various nanotube samples.},

abstract = {With significant economic development over the last several decades in China, urban land has increasingly sprawled and encroached upon arable land and rural settlements. In this context, this paper explores the dynamic spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of rural settlement loss and arable land depletion in the process of urban expansion, which could offer a theoretical basis and scientific support for further research of rural development and restructuring. The conclusions of the study are summarized as follows: (1) approximately 80{\%} of urban growth has been at the expense of rural settlements (23.42{\%}) and arable land (57.14{\%}) in Beijing; and (2) an obvious rural non-agriculturization-intensive belt was observed in spatial units from 1985 to 2010, primarily distributed between the Fourth Ring Road and the Fifth Ring Road. Non-agriculturization is defined here as the conversion of land formerly used for agricultural purposes, including rural settlements and arable land, to more densely developed urban uses. (3) The spatial distribution of fastest, fast and medium non-agriculturization began to shift from the northern area to the southern area after 2005. (4) The curves of variation of rural non-agriculturization intensity under urbanization along the urban-rural gradient presented as inverted “U” shapes leading away from the socioeconomic center, while that along the motorways displayed exponential decay. Adhering to the policy of urbanization strategy will be essential for rural restructuring in China.},

@book{DeSwart2018,
abstract = {In this introductory chapter the topic of the book is explained: distinguish- ing valid patterns of reasoning from invalid ones. The validity may depend on the meaning of connectives like ‘if ..., then ...', ‘and', ‘or' and ‘not', in which case one speaks of propositional logic. But the validity may also depend on the mean- ing of the quantifiers ‘for all' and ‘for some', in which case one speaks of predicate logic. If we extend the logical language with symbols for addition and multiplication of natural numbers, G¨odel's famous incompleteness theorems show up. In order to have meaning, logical formulae presuppose a universe of discourse, or a set, which may be finite or infinite. In particular infinite sets have peculiar properties. If the validity of a reasoning pattern also depends on the meaning ofmodalities, like ‘nec- essary' and ‘possible', one speaks of modal logic. Modal logic helps to clarify or solve certain issues in the philosophy of language. It turns out that validity of an argument is also dependent on philosophical presuppositions. Changing the philo- sophical point of view may result in intuitionistic logic. The language of logic may be used as a programming language: Prolog (Programming in Logic); and the the- ory of sets is the basis for relational databases and the query language SQL; another application of logic is social choice theory. Fallacies and unfair discussion methods are abundantly present in daily discourse and hence deserve attention too.},

abstract = {Electrospinning is a highly versatile technology to process polymers or related materials into fibrous materials with diameters ranging from micrometer to nanometer scale. In the early years, the electrospun materials were mainly polymers and the morphologies were mainly fibers. Considerable progress has been achieved in the preceding two decades, which include electrospinning of metals, metal oxides, carbon species and organic/inorganic composites, and generating more morphologies beyond fibers such as beads, tubes and even hierarchical structures. In addition, a myriad of promising applications have been explored, mainly including biological, energy, catalysis, environment and mechanical enhancement, more than half focused on biological applications. Electrospun nanomaterials can be designed to mimic the structural features of an extracellular matrix for cell growth and nutrients transport. Such materials may be designed to enhance aesthetic wound healing, owing to the ability to absorb excess exudates, maintain a moist microenvironment to enhance epithelial regrowth, and offer painless to removal. Electrospun nanomaterials encapsulated or with attached bioactive molecules and drugs are regarded as suitable candidates for delivery applications. They may also be utilized in medical diagnosis to enhance the specificity, sensitivity and signaling capabilities due to the high porosity and large surface area. In addition, electrospun nanomaterials can be assembled into a variety of fascinating biomimic structures and functions. All these attributes make electrospinning a powerful tool for fabricating bio-functional nanomaterials for a range of biological applications concerning human health that mainly include tissue engineering, wound healing, drug/bioactive molecules delivery, diagnosis, and biomimetics. This review highlights recent advances in the topological design and biological applications of electrospun bio-functional nanomaterials. The topologies are categorized to portray a comprehensive “topology periodic table”, providing a concise and clear map offering a reference for scientists or engineers to opt for specific topology with desirable functions targeting a special application, as well as corresponding fabrication strategy. The topologies of electrospun nanomaterials are classified into three categories: Individuals, Hybrids and Assemblies according to the intrinsic logical relationships. The state-of-the-art progress on electrospun nanomaterials together with biological applications, challenges, and future directions are comprehensively summarized.},

abstract = {Aromatic polyimides (PIs) are high-performance polymers with rigid heterocyclic imide rings and aromatic benzene rings in their macromolecular backbones. Owing to excellent mechanical properties and thermal stability, as well as readily adjustable molecular structures, PIs have been widely adopted for many applications related to electronics, aerospace, automobile, and other industries. In recent years, PI fibers prepared by electrospinning of polyamic acid (PAA) precursor nanofibers followed by imidization (commonly known as electrospun PI nanofibers) have attracted growing interests. Herein, the preparation, evaluation, and application of electrospun PI nanofibers are reviewed. PI polymers and the electrospinning technique are introduced first followed by the preparation of electrospun nanofibers of homo-PI, co-PI, blend-PI, and PI composite. Subsequently, the mechanical and thermal properties of electrospun PI nanofibers are presented; in particular, the mechanical properties of individual electrospun PI nanofibers are highlighted. Thereafter, various applications of electrospun PI nanofibers are outlined, including reinforcement of composites, Li-ion battery separators, fuel cell proton exchange membranes, sensors, microelectronics, high-temperature filtration media, super-hydrophobic PI nanofibers, and PI-based carbon nanofibers. In the final section of conclusions and perspectives, future research endeavors and high-value applications of electrospun PI nanofibers are discussed.},

abstract = {The level of air pollution removal by green roofs in Chicago was quantified using a dry deposition model. The result showed that a total of 1675kg of air pollutants was removed by 19.8ha of green roofs in one year with O3 accounting for 52{\%} of the total, NO2 (27{\%}), PM10 (14{\%}), and SO2 (7{\%}). The highest level of air pollution removal occurred in May and the lowest in February. The annual removal per hectare of green roof was 85kgha−1yr−1. The amount of pollutants removed would increase to 2046.89metric tons if all rooftops in Chicago were covered with intensive green roofs. Although costly, the installation of green roofs could be justified in the long run if the environmental benefits were considered. The green roof can be used to supplement the use of urban trees in air pollution control, especially in situations where land and public funds are not readily available.},

abstract = {We proposed herein a facile, fast and low cost metal-free photochemical method for preparing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of a solution containing mixture of a photoinitiator such as phenylbis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (GR-XBPO) and a triethylamine (TEA) in ethanol. Free radicals are generated via photoinitiator decomposition under UV irradiation. In this process, graphene oxide (GO) rapidly reduced to graphene via extensively removal of oxygen-containing functional groups (OFGs) by free radicals in the presence of anti-oxide inhibitor such as TEA exists. Furthermore, we prepared flexible conductive micropatterns over rGO/SU-8 composites deposited on several substrates (e.g., glass, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), aluminum, and silicon) by dispersing rGO into a photocurable SU-8 resin by means of a photolithography technique. The incorporation of rGO changed the properties of the composites. Thus, the behavior of SU-8 resin shifted from insulating to conductive/antistatic upon incorporation of rGO nanocomposites. This preliminary study provides us with the opportunity to not only develop an efficient metal-free photochemical reduction route towards GO but also obtain a processable conductive micropattern by optimizing the overall processing parameters, and maximizing the advantages of them for future carbon-based nanocomposites at large scale.},

We used a standard LightScribe DVD optical drive to do the direct laser reduction of graphite oxide films to graphene. The produced films are mechanically robust, show high electrical conductivity (1738 siemens per meter) and specific surface area (1520 square meters per gram), and can thus be used directly as EC electrodes without the need for binders or current collectors, as is the case for conventional ECs. Devices made with these electrodes exhibit ultrahigh energy density values in different electrolytes while maintaining the high power density and excellent cycle stability of ECs. Moreover, these ECs maintain excellent electrochemical attributes under high mechanical stress and thus hold promise for high-power, flexible electronics.},

abstract = {The fast pyrolysis of waste tires (WTs) is studied by quasi-isothermal thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis, kinetic modelling and an analytical pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The TGA demonstrated that the WTs pyrolysis is ruled by devolatilization/condensation and depropagation reactions, up to 482 °C. At higher temperatures, the cyclization and aromatization of primary products take place to form mostly monoaromatics. Py-GC/MS experiments were performed under kinetic regime according to the thermal map established by the ratio between Biot́s (31.25) and Py-numbers (7.7⋅106). Limonene (51{\%}) and isoprene (20.5{\%}) were the major compounds detected at temperatures below 435 °C, while above 600 °C limonene was converted to mono-aromatics (SBTX = 28.7{\%}). The approach to equilibrium of Diels-Alder reaction demonstrated that there is an equilibrium-ruled behavior between isoprene and limonene, particularly at T {\textgreater} 600 °C. The Ea values calculated by the Starinḱs model ranged from 101.5 to 176.7 kJ/mol, while for model-based kinetics it was 152.7 kJ/kmol. The integration of TGA, kinetic modelling and Py-GC/MS provided insights into pyrolysis reaction mechanism.},

abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) is considered as one of the major problems in the 21st century posed to human beings as a result of urbanization and industrialization of human civilization. The large amount of heat generated from urban structures, as they consume and re-radiate solar radiations, and from the anthropogenic heat sources are the main causes of UHI. The two heat sources increase the temperatures of an urban area as compared to its surroundings, which is known as Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII). The problem is even worse in cities or metropolises with large population and extensive economic activities. The estimated three billion people living in the urban areas in the world are directly exposed to the problem, which will be increased significantly in the near future. Due to the severity of the problem, vast research effort has been dedicated and a wide range of literature is available for the subject. The literature available in this area includes the latest research approaches, concepts, methodologies, latest investigation tools and mitigation measures. This study was carried out to review and summarize this research area through an investigation of the most important feature of UHI. It was concluded that the heat re-radiated by the urban structures plays the most important role which should be investigated in details to study urban heating especially the UHI. It was also concluded that the future research should be focused on design and planning parameters for reducing the effects of urban heat island and ultimately living in a better environment. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

In addition to up-to-date analyses of, inter alia, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Common Security and Defence Policy and the Common Commercial Policy, it highlights the EU's external powers with regard to the environment, fundamental rights and development cooperation. Moreover, it includes dedicated chapters exploring the relations with neighbouring countries, and explaining the complex interplay between rules of domestic, European and international provenance. The second edition of this established text (the first edition was published under the title Layered Global Player in 2011) has been geared even more specifically towards students, for example through the inclusion of chapter overviews, clarifying boxes, and supplementary examples, while a meticulous review of the narrative has further enhanced its accessibility. As before, the book's compact dimensions, transparent structure and engaging style of writing enable readers to master the main features of this gripping field of law with ease. It thus remains an invaluable resource for students and lecturers alike.},

abstract = {AC pulse-modulated electrohydrodynamic direct-writing (EDW) was utilized to direct-write orderly micro/nanofibrous structure on the flexible insulating polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. During the EDW process, AC electrical field induced charges to reciprocate along the jet and decreased the charge repulsive force that applied on charged jet. Thanks to the smaller charge repulsive force, stable straight jet can be built up to direct-write orderly micro/nanofibrous structures on the insulating substrate. The minimum motion velocity required to direct-write straight line fibrous structure on insulating PET substrate was 700 mm/s. Moreover, the influences of AC voltage amplitude, frequency, and duty cycle ratio on the line width of fibrous structures were investigated. This work proposes a novel solution to overcome the inherent charge repulsion emerging on the insulating substrate, and promotes the application of EDW technology on the flexible electronics.},

The formation of N-hydroxy-Trp-P-2 by nuclei of PCB- or MC-treated rat livers was greater than that by nuclei of untreated or PB-treated rat livers. Similar results were observed with microsomes, which suggests that Trp-P-2 is metabolized by the same type of monoxygenase system in nuclei as in microsomes. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Scientists have begun using self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers to manufacture open source digital designs of scientific equipment. This approach is refined here to develop a novel instrument capable of performing automated large-area four-point probe measurements. The designs for conversion of a RepRap 3-D printer to a 2-D open source four-point probe (OS4PP) measurement device are detailed for the mechanical and electrical systems. Free and open source software and firmware are developed to operate the tool. The OS4PP was validated against a wide range of discrete resistors and indium tin oxide (ITO) samples of different thicknesses both pre- and post-annealing. The OS4PP was then compared to two commercial proprietary systems. Results of resistors from 10 to 1 M$\Omega$ show errors of less than 1{\%} for the OS4PP. The 3-D mapping of sheet resistance of ITO samples successfully demonstrated the automated capability to measure non-uniformities in large-area samples. The results indicate that all measured values are within the same order of magnitude when compared to two proprietary measurement systems. In conclusion, the OS4PP system, which costs less than 70{\%} of manual proprietary systems, is comparable electrically while offering automated 100 micron positional accuracy for measuring sheet resistance over larger areas.},

It is crucial for lawyers to be aware of the different ways in which societal problems can be solved and to be able to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different legal solutions. In this respect, being a lawyer involves being able to reason like a lawyer, even more than having detailed knowledge of particular sets of rules. Introduction to Law reflects this view by focusing on the functions of rules and on ways of arguing the relative qualities of alternative legal solutions. Where 'positive' law is discussed, the emphasis is on the legal questions that must be addressed by a field of law and on the different solutions which have been adopted by, for instance, the common law and civil law tradition. The law of specific jurisdictions is discussed to illustrate possible answers to questions such as when the existence of a valid contract is assumed.},

Due to high contact angle ({\textgreater}150°), water drops readily roll off the lotus leaf surface compiling dirt particles. This self – cleaning lotus effect has found huge attention in daily life. Many surfaces in day-to-day life eventually get contaminated due to the accumulation of dust/dirt or through air pollution. A huge amount of money, labor and energy is wasted in their restoration. The self – cleaning superhydrophobic coating is one of the best options for this problem. In this study, the suspension of hydrophobic silica nanoparticles was dip and/or spray coated on the body of motorcycle, building wall, mini boat, solar cell panel, window glass, cotton shirt, fabric shoes, paper (currency notes), metal, wood, sponges, plastic and marble. Every coated substrate exhibited superhydrophobicity with water contact angle nearly 160° and sliding angle less than 6°. The self-cleaning performance of the superhydrophobic coating applied on various substrates was thoroughly evaluated. The specific purpose of this article is to explore the possible industrial applications of self – cleaning superhydrophobic coatings.},

In cloud computing, IT-related capabilities are provided as services, accessible without requiring detailed knowledge of the underlying technologies, and with minimal management effort. The great savings promised by the cloud are however offset by the perceived security threats feared by users. This paper gives an overview of cloud computing, and discusses related security challenges. We emphasize that although there are many technological approaches that can improve cloud security, there are currently no one-size-fits-all solutions, and future work has to tackle challenges such as service level agreements for security, as well as holistic mechanisms for ensuring accountability in the cloud.},

abstract = {Electrospinning is becoming an efficient method to produce fibers in the submicron range, but the bending instability of conventional electrospinning system (CES) brings limitations in the distinctive deposition of electrospun fibers. Herein, we proposed a strategy to update the electrospinning system through establishment of a uniform electric field, realizing 3D printing of electrospun fibers with well-controlled, low-cost, and template-free manners. The uniform field electrospinning (UFES) apparatus is configured by inserting the electrospinning nozzle into the center of an aided metal plate. The electric field simulation of UFES indicates a uniform distribution between the aided metal plate and the collector, while a diverging and weaker electric field is produced by CES. The collector of UFES is mounted on a translation stage, which moves along x and y axes under computer control. The distinctive deposition of electrospun fibers produces fibrous mats with rectangular patterns of different grid sizes, and butterfly and TaiJi figures with high resolutions are directly written by UFES. The layer-by-layer deposition of electrospun fibers under UFES produces microscale Mongolian yurts with distinct hollow structure. Fibrous blocks with an average width of 120 $\mu$m and height of 630 $\mu$m were printed by UFES from conductive polymer composites and constructed into strain sensors. The electric current strength of fibrous microblocks changes sharply in response to the finger bending and release, indicating the capability to monitor human motions. Thus, this study demonstrates that the UFES becomes an easy-handling strategy for 3D printing of electrospun fibers to create complex geometries.},

abstract = {Efficiently computing light transport in participating media in a manner that is robust to variations in media density, scattering albedo, and anisotropy is a difficult and important problem in realistic image synthesis. While many specialized rendering techniques can efficiently resolve subsets of transport in specific media, no single approach can robustly handle all types of effects. To address this problem we unify volumetric density estimation, using point and beam estimators, and Monte Carlo solutions to the path integral formulation of the rendering and radiative transport equations. We extend multiple importance sampling to correctly handle combinations of these fundamentally different classes of estimators. This, in turn, allows us to develop a single rendering algorithm that correctly combines the benefits and mediates the limitations of these powerful volume rendering techniques.

abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of face velocity, nanofiber packing density and nanofiber layer thickness on filtration efficiency and pressure drop of filters with nanofibers coated on a substrate. The substrate is a non-woven microfiber medium with negligible filtration efficiency and pressure drop as compared to nanofiber layer. The nanofiber layer is composed of electrospun polyethylene oxide nanofibers with mean diameter equals to 208nm. Test aerosol is sodium chloride with size ranging from 50 to 480nm. Experimental results show that the most penetrating particle size decreases from 140 to 90nm when nanofiber packing density increases from 3.9 to 36×10−3. When face velocity is increased from 5 to 10cms−1, the filtration efficiency generally decreases, and the reduction becomes larger at smaller particle sizes especially for those below 100nm. By maintaining nanofiber packing density at 8.7×10−2 and almost triple the nanofiber layer thickness, the most penetrating particle size decreases slightly from 140 to 120nm. This suggests nanofiber layer thickness has less prominent effect on most penetrating particle size than nanofiber packing density. By adding more nanofibers on microfiber substrate in a single layer especially under high fiber packing, the pressure drop across the filter elevates without significantly improving the filtration efficiency exhibiting a diminishing return behavior. Hence, the method of “multi-layering” is proposed to fabricate nanofiber filter with greatly reduced pressure drop. This is advantageous for high efficiency applications with nanofibers of high packing density.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {The acute waste management problems, coupled with the proliferation of small scale industries in many developing countries, make low quality water treatment before use inevitable in the long run. These industries have the potential to discharge effluent containing chemicals and heavy metals into the environment. The indiscriminative use of pharmaceutical products by households in many of these countries is another source of health concern. Low quality water treatment in these countries has however been hampered by the high cost of infrastructure provision and maintenance. Cost-sharing among stakeholders appears to be a promising strategy to finance and maintain the wastewater treatment infrastructure. In this study therefore, the willingness and ability of urban open space commercial vegetable farmers to pay for reclaimed water for irrigation purposes has been assessed. One hundred open space commercial vegetable farmers and four vegetable farmers' associations were selected and interviewed in Kumasi in Ghana using semi-structured interview schedules and interview guides respectively. The results of the study show that approximately three out of every five vegetable farmers were willing to pay for reclaimed water for irrigation. The results further show that the probability of being willing to pay by farmers who agreed that the current water they used for irrigation was harmful is approximately 5.3 times greater than that of those who did not. The analysis of the farmers' ability to pay revealed that all the farmers would be capable of paying for reclaimed water at a price of US{\$}0.11/m(3). This has implications for land tenure security and vegetable consumers' willingness to pay higher prices for the produce.},

abstract = {Polymer nanofibers, with diameters in the nanometer range, possess larger surface areas per unit mass and permit easier addition of surface functionalities compared with polymer microfibers. Hence, polymer nanofiber mats are being considered for use as filters, scaffolds for tissue engineering, protective clothing, reinforcement in composite materials and sensors. Although some of these applications are in the development stage, a few have been commercially exploited. Research on polymer nanofibers, nanofiber mats, and their applications has seen a remarkable growth over the last few years. However, a review of the various issues related to these nanofibers has not been published. This article presents a review of the recent trends in the processing methods and characterization techniques for polymer nanofibers. Research challenges and future trends in the processing and characterization of polymer nanofibers are discussed in the article. Five processing methods have been examined in this review, namely drawing, template synthesis, phase separation, self-assembly, and electrospinning. Among these methods, electrospinning has been used to convert a large variety of polymers into nanofibers and may be the only process that has the potential for mass production. The structure, morphology, and geometry of nanofibers and the porosity and tensile properties of nanofiber mats can be investigated through conventional techniques and instruments. But new techniques are needed for the mechanical testing of single nanofibers. Although measurement of mechanical properties such as tensile modulus, strength, and elongation is difficult because of the small diameters of the fibers, these properties are crucial for the proper use of nanofiber mats.},

Different methods, techniques and instruments for urban sustainability assessment that help determine how cities can become more sustainable have emerged over a period of time. Among these, indicator-based approaches contribute to building of sustainable self-regulated systems that integrate development and environment protection. Hence, these provide a solid foundation for decision-making at all levels and are being increasingly used. The present paper builds on the background of the available literature and suggests the need for benchmarking indicator-based approach in a given urban area and incorporating various local issues, thus enhancing the long-term sustainability of cities which can be developed by introducing sustainability indicators into the urban planning process.},

abstract = {Electrospinning is a fast emerging technique for producing ultrafine fibers by utilizing electrostatic repulsive forces. The technique has gathered much attention due to the emergence of nanotechnology that sparked worldwide research interest in nanomaterials for their preparation and application in biomedicine and drug delivery. Electrospinning is a simple, adaptable, cost-effective, and versatile technique for producing nanofibers. For effective and efficient use of the technique, several processing parameters need to be optimized for fabricating polymeric nanofibers. The nanofiber morphology, size, porosity, surface area, and topography can be refined by varying these parameters. Such flexibility and diversity in nanofiber fabrication by electrospinning has broadened the horizons for widespread application of nanofibers in the areas of drug and gene delivery, wound dressing, and tissue engineering. Drug-loaded electrospun nanofibers have been used in implants, transdermal systems, wound dressings, and as devices for aiding the prevention of postsurgical abdominal adhesions and infection. They show great promise for use in drug delivery provided that one can confidently control the processing variables during fabrication. This paper provides a concise incursion into the application of electrospun nanofibers in drug delivery and cites pertinent processing parameters that may influence the performance of the nanofibers when applied to drug delivery.},

With its roots in the consumer appliance market, Haier extended its product portfolio also to the consumer electronic market. The company succeeded in transforming itself from an imitating manufacturer to one of the world's most innovative companies. Using knowledge from several sources, Haier is able to stay up-to-date with consumers' constantly changing needs. Furthermore, Haier is constantly developing and adjusting its business strategies to meet the demands of the changing market environments. Haier refrained from major brand acquisitions to enter developed markets at the beginning of its internationalization process. Instead of purchasing an existing domestic brand to enter international markets, Haier focused on positioning itself as a local brand in the different world markets by using local staff who would build up a market-specific brand. In order to reduce its strong dependency on its domestic market, Haier is likely to extend its global activities in the more mature markets (North America and Western Europe) in the near future.},

The suspended electrospun nanofibers together with the RF gel posts were subsequently pyrolyzed in an inert atmosphere to yield large area monolithic structures of suspended glassy carbon nanofibers (CNF) integrated on RF gel derived carbon posts. The electrospun nanofibers self-assemble to connect the posts owing to a stronger electric field on their tips, obviating the need for positioning and integration of carbon nanowires with the underlying microstructures and paving the way for fabricating novel carbon based micro and nanoscale devices. The fabrication technique also allowed measurements of electrical conductivity of a single suspended CNF between carbon electrodes using I-V characteristics and comparison of the carbon nanowire conductivities for the CNF derived from different polymer precursors. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {After a general description of the Burrows-Wheeler transform and a brief survey of recent work on processing its output, the paper examines the coding of the zero-runs from the MTF recoding stage, an aspect with little prior treatment. It is concluded that the original scheme proposed by Wheeler is extremely efficient and unlikely to be much improved. The paper then proposes some new interpretations and uses of the Burrows-Wheeler transform, with new insights and approaches to lossless compression, perhaps including techniques from error correction. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This clear-sighted resource critically examines the status of clinical psychology practice across the diverse regions of the world. Dispatches from North and Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, China, South Korea, Australia, Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere illustrate in depth the universality of mental distress and disorders, and the intersection of local knowledge and established standards in providing effective care. Pathology and its treatment are viewed in light of cultural values, belief systems, ethics, and norms, reflecting the evolution of clinical practice toward personalized care and culturally sensitive intervention. This important information serves a number of immediate and long-term goals, including developing culture-specific diagnoses and treatments, improving professional competencies, and the ongoing exchange of ideas within a global field to benefit all patients worldwide. Coverage compares key areas such as: {\textperiodcentered}Concepts of mental pathology and health. {\textperiodcentered} The sociopolitical aspects of psychology, rooted in the history of the country/region. {\textperiodcentered} Popularly used approaches to intervention. {\textperiodcentered} Types of services and providers. {\textperiodcentered} The state of training and credentialing. {\textperiodcentered} Relationships between clinical psychology and indigenous healing traditions. The audience for Clinical Psychology across the World includes advanced undergraduate and graduate students and trainees/interns in clinical psychology, as well as developers of training programs. It can also serve asa valuable supplementary text for seminars or lectures on clinical psychology.},

abstract = {Fluorescein derivatives are important fluorescent probes which can be used for detection and optical imaging. Fluorescein derivatives are usually constructed by introducing aldehyde groups or esterified onto fluorescein xanthene ring and benzene moiety. Typically, the research direction of connecting amino groups with fluorescein monoaldehyde is in hot. Because of their high activity, these derivatives can be complexed with the analytes to produce changes of colors and the increase or decrease of fluorescence intensity. This article reviewed fluorescein probes in the past two years according to classification of different analytes including metal ions, anions, small molecules and biological macromolecules. The synthesis methods, optical properties, possible mechanisms and applications of fluorescein probes are summarized. This article provides a reference for the screening of fluorescein probes with high sensitivity and biological detection and can propel their further applications in sensing and detection of analytes.},

@article{Lee2018a,
abstract = {Electrospinning is a straightforward yet versatile technique for the preparation of polymeric nanofibers with diameters in the range of nanometers to micrometers, and has been rapidly developed in the last two decades. Nanocarbon materials, usually referring to carbon nanotubes, graphene, and fullerenes with their derivatives including quantum dots, nanoﬁbers, and nanoribbons, have received increasing attention due to their unique structural characteristics and outstanding physico-chemical properties. Incorporation of nanocarbons in electrospun polymeric ﬁbers has been used to increase the functionality of ﬁbers, for example, to improve the mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, as well as confer biofunctionality as scaffolds in tissue engineering and sensors, when the advantageous properties given by the encapsulated materials are transferred to the ﬁbers. In this review, we provide an overview of polymer-based composites reinforced with nanocarbons via the electrospinning technique. After a brief introduction of various types of nanocarbons, we summarize the latest progress of the design and fabrication of electrospun polymeric nanofibers with nanocarbon fillers. With regard to the preparation of composites, we focus on functionalization strategies of nanocarbons and the production of random {\&} aligned polymeric nanocomposites. Then, the physical properties such as mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties are also reviewed for electrospun nanocomposite nanofibers reinforced with nanocarbons, especially carbon nanotubes. Benefiting from the exceptional properties including superior electric conductivity, high porosities, unique mat structure, etc. the polymeric composite nanofibers have demonstrated numerous advantages and promising properties in the fields of tissue engineering and sensors. In the application section, we will give state-of-the-art examples to demonstrate the advantages of electrospun polymer-based nanocomposites. Finally, the conclusion and challenge of the polymer-based nanocomposites are also presented. We believe the efforts made in this review would promote the understanding of the methods of preparation and unique physical and chemical properties of nanocarbon reinforced polymer-based nanocomposites.},
