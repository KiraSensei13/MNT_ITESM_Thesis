abstract = {Advances in Tissue Engineering (TE) demand strategies to apply new biomaterials and processing technologies. In this context, especially computer aided additive manufacturing (AM) has turned out as a promising tool to tailor scaffold architectures with high precision. However, there is currently a lack of appropriate AM methods, since the majority face serious drawbacks regarding printing accuracy and speed, as well as limitations regarding the range of applicable biomaterials. Here, we present the simple AM processing of poly(lactide-block-ethylene glycol-block-lactide) (PLA-PEG-PLA) triblock copolymers via melt electrospinning writing (MEW). Furthermore, we demonstrate the accurate deposition of fibers (f{\O} = 31 ± 2 µm) made of copolymer blends with low-molecular PLA incorporating solid 45S5 bioactive glass (BG) particles. Thus, we introduce MEW for the printing of highly porous, particle loaded scaffolds with micron-sized composite fibers with potential application in bone TE.},

abstract = {Electrospinning is recognized as an efficient and versatile technique that has been widely used in nanoscale fiber fabrication. Electric field manipulation is one of the efficient ways to precisely control an electrospinning jet. While there have been several studies of the electric field manipulation effect on nanofiber deposition control, these works are limited to the control of a far-field electrospinning (FFES) jet to deposit in one dimension or to suppress the chaotic whipping mode to some extent. Few work has been done to control a near-field electrospinning (NFES) jet for deposition of complex patterns using electric field manipulation. To this end, we propose a novel design by adding a moving sharp-pin electrode beneath the plane collector. The sharp pin electrode is charged with a positive voltage and moved to redistribute the electric field for jet trajectory control, while the plane collector is kept stationary. The focusing of the electric field and the guiding effect of the jet trajectory due to the additional sharp-pin electrode are studied and demonstrated. Various parameters (voltage, electrode translation speed, and collection mechanism) are analyzed to experimentally study their effects on the fiber deposition control. It is demonstrated in the current work the feasibility of controlling a single fiber for deposition of complex patterns in near-field electrospinning by manipulating the electric field distribution.},

abstract = {Electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA), or simply Electrospraying is the process of influencing the breakup of a liquid into droplets by using a strong electric field. There can be different modes of Electrospraying depending, basically, on the created electric field strength and the liquid flowrate, for a specified liquid. Among these modes, the so-called cone-jet mode is the most explored one. This is due to its ability to produce highly charged monodisperse droplets in the nano- to micro-meter size range. Another mode of interest, which can also produce monodisperse droplets is the simple-jet mode. This mode is less explored when compared to the former. Within the papers that were explored by the authors, Agostinho et al. (2012) were the first authors to carefully investigate and characterize this mode. In their work, the authors reported about the influence of the electric field and the liquid flowrate on the droplets' size and spray dispersion. They also pointed out that the charge on these droplets can be expressed as a certain percentage of their Rayleigh limit. So far, there has been no model proposed to describe the droplets' trajectories in the simple-jet mode. This paper describes the design and the implementation of a physical model for determining the droplet trajectories in this mode. The model is done, specifically, for a single nozzle/ring-up configuration. It is a two-dimensional model, which solves the force balance equation for each droplet breaking up from the jet. It takes into consideration; the initial droplet velocity, the force of gravity, the electric field force, the inter-droplet coulombic force and the drag force. The droplets' deformation and reorientation were hypothesized, from observations, to play a major role in initiating the droplets' dispersion. They were simulated by implementing periodic displacements on the droplets' center of charge from its center of mass. The calculated droplets' trajectories' envelope angle was fitted to the experimental envelope angle by adjusting the droplet charge around the values that were reported by Agostinho et al. (2012). The model was validated by comparing the shapes of the theoretical and experimental sprays. The model offers new possibilities of modeling the droplets' trajectories in complex geometries, and of introducing additional forces to manipulate their trajectories in the simple-jet mode.},

The method, dubbed "biased AC electrospinning", employs a combination of DC and AC potentials and results in highly-aligned mats of polymer or composite polymer fibers. The relationship between specific processing variables such as the AC frequency and the magnitude of the DC offset was investigated and related to the resulting fiber stability and uniformity. For optimum fiber stability, the AC frequency must fall within a relatively narrow range. The upper and lower frequency limits were measured for a small group of polymers and polymer composites and were qualitatively related to solution properties and processing variables. Potential applications of well-ordered nanofiber materials include tissue engineering, filtration, drug delivery, and microelectronics.},

The average diameter of nanofibers and their distributions were determined from 100 measurements of the random fibers with image analyzer software (manual microstructure distance measurement). Electrical conductivity of the prepared mats was characterized using standard four point probe method. The fibers with diameter ranging from 60 to 600 nm were obtained. The PANI/PAN blends containing up to the PANI content of 30{\%} could be electrospun into the continuous fibrous structure, although pure PANI solution was not able to be electrospun into the fibrous structure. Average of fiber diameter decreased with increasing PANI content and electrospinning temperature. The electrospun PANI/PAN fibers at 50 °C and 75 °C showed smaller diameters with much better uniformity than those electrospun at 25 °C. The electrical conductivity of the mats increased with the increase of PANI content in the blend with percolation threshold of 0.5{\%}.},

abstract = {Developed from the far field electrospinning (FFES) process, near-field electrospinning (NFES) holds the promise to become a direct-writing technology with high throughput and multi-material capability not only in 2D but also in 3D space. The underlying problem is the deposition of fibers on top of each other. Since the fibers are of sub-micron size, the accuracy of the deposition must reach the same level to realize this requirement. Deposition inaccuracy is attributable to numerous sources including the residual charges remaining on the deposited fibers that repel the fiber being deposited as well as the inappropriate shape of the electric field guiding the deposition process. To eliminate these two influences, this paper proposes two possible solutions. In the first, the polarity of the electrodes is being switched in subsequent deposition passes, while in the second the ground electrode plate is replaced by a grounded pin to modify the shape of the electric field. A comparative experimental analysis of the feasibility of these two methods is presented and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.},

However, electric field between the array-nozzle interferes with the stability and uniformity of near-field electrospinning, and little research has been done in this field. To clarify the electric field interference generated by array-nozzle, the experimental results compared with the simulation are discussed. In this work, electric field interference between the five-nozzle linear arrangement near-field electrospinning process was demonstrated by the initial ejection behavior, the electric field distribution of near-field electrospinning environment and the deposition spacing of fibers. In addition, we developed a simple and flexible method serving as a quantitative evaluation index for evaluating the degree of electric field interference. Then, the mapping effects of electric field interference of nozzle structure on the surface morphology and uniformity of aligned fibers were studied, including the number of nozzle, nozzle spacing and nozzle length with linear and toothed arrangement. According to the result of experiment and characterization, suitable arrayed nozzle parameters for stably direct-write aligned array pattern with near-field electrospinning were available, whose geometric parameters are linear two-nozzle with a nozzle spacing of 2 mm and a nozzle length of 6.35 mm. Finally, on the basis of our previous research, a microfluidic channel was successfully prepared on polydimethylsiloxane by two-nozzle cooperation, which verified the rationality of the geometry.},

A small wire diameter and a small inter-wire spacing were obtained by controlling the electric field, the spinneret-to-collector distance, the pyrolysis parameters, the linear speed of the spinneret, the rotational speed of the collector. Using a simple scaling analysis, we show how the straightness and the diameter of the wires can be controlled by the electric field and the distance of the spinneret to the collector. A small inter-wire spacing, as predicted by a simple model, was achieved by simultaneously controlling the linear speed of the spinneret and the rotational speed of the collector. Rapid drying of the polymer nanowires enabled the facile fabrication of suspended wires over various structures. Patterned polyacrylonitrile wires were carbonized using standard stabilization and pyrolysis to obtain carbon nanowires. Suspended carbon nanowires with a diameter of {\textless}50 nm were obtained. We also established a method for making patterned, highly graphitized structures by using the aforementioned carbon wire structures as a template for chemical vapor deposition of graphite.

The deposition of double nozzle NFES has been studied with Coulomb's law and theoretical derivation has been verified by the experimental conclusion. The experiment result and theoretical derivation are helpful to get different distance of direct-written fibers by adjusting working distance or needle spacing to change distance of fibers largely and adjusting voltage to change distance slowly.

abstract = {Near-field electrospinning (NFES) was developed to overcome the intrinsic instability of traditional electrospinning processes and to facilitate the controllable deposition of nanofibers under a reduced electric field. This technique offers a straightforward and versatile method for the precision patterning of two-dimensional (2D) nanofibers. However, three-dimensional (3D) stacked structures built by NFES have been limited to either micron-scale sizes or special shapes. Herein, we report on a direct-write 3D NFES technique to construct self-aligned, template-free, 3D stacked nanoarchitectures by simply adding salt to the polymer solution. Numerical simulations suggested that the electric field could be tuned to achieve self-aligned nanofibers by adjusting the conductivity of the polymer solution. This was confirmed experimentally by using poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solutions containing 0.1-1.0 wt{\%} NaCl. Using 0.1 wt{\%} NaCl, nanowalls with a maximum of 80 layers could be built with a width of 92 ± 3 nm, height of 6.6 ± 0.1 $\mu$m, and aspect ratio (height/width) of 72. We demonstrate the 3D printing of nanoskyscrapers with various designs, such as curved "nanowall arrays", nano "jungle gyms," and "nanobridges". Further, we present an application of the 3D stacked nanofiber arrays by preparing transparent and flexible polydimethylsiloxane films embedded with Ag-sputtered nanowalls as 3D nanoelectrodes. The conductivity of the nanoelectrodes can be precisely tuned by adjusting the number of 3D printed layers, without sacrificing transmittance (98.5{\%}). The current NFES approach provides a simple, reliable route to build 3D stacked nanoarchitectures with high-aspect ratios for potential application in smart materials, energy devices, and biomedical applications.},

abstract = {A mechano-electrospinning method is presented to direct-write oriented nanofiber with high deposition accuracy in continuously tunable manner. This method uses a large nozzle to deposit high-resolution fiber-arrays by near-field localization. Due to the existence of mechanical drawing force, a higher resolution pattern can be direct-written by a lower voltage, which just keeps the Taylor cone stable. Then the fiber is stretched through a moving substrate, by which the deposited fiber can be continuously tuned from 400 nm to 200 nm in a linear relationship. The effects of the speed on the diameter and morphology of fibers are studied, and the analysis of the mechanism of the fiber alignment is given. The positionability and controllability make mechano-electrospinning very different from the traditional electrospinning, which only collects the fibers in the form of nonwoven fabric. In addition, the fibers fabricated by this method can directly deposit over a large flat area in the form of arrays and complex patterns with high precision.},

abstract = {HYPOTHESIS The electrostatic initiation of a jet from the meniscus of a polymeric solution is a key step in near-field electrospinning (NFES), however this process is not sufficiently understood to determine a criterion for the critical emitter voltage triggering the jet, nor to optimize the electrodes. It is expected that the jet initiation in NFES is similar to that in cone-jet electrosprays, and can be described with a first principles model. EXPERIMENTS The electrostatic jet initiation of an SU-8 polymeric solution is studied with two different electrode geometries to quantify the initiation parameters and illustrate the optimization of the electric field. A first-principles model is developed to predict and analyze the initiation. FINDINGS Two jet emission mechanisms are identified: one in which the jet is ejected from a free-standing conical meniscus; and one resulting from the contact of the meniscus with the collector, as it evolves from a spherical to a conical shape. Both are triggered by a critical emitter potential. The former produces the thinnest jets with a diameter that depends on the properties of the fluid, while the latter is an alternative to existing mechanical initiation methods. The model reproduces well the experimental phenomena including the critical voltage.},

abstract = {This study presents a novel droplet-jet mode of near-field electrospinning which allows microscale control of helix patterns using nanofiber. While the cone-jet mode has been used to generate a printable nanofiber to date, the cone-jet mode requires a high applied voltage with a long jet travel distance to obtain the nanofiber, resulting in a large coiling diameter. In order to integrate the near-field electrospinning into microscale devices, it is important to achieve a comparable nanofiber pattern resolution. Herein, we have demonstrated printing of nanofibers with a coiling diameter of sub-10 $\mu$m, which is produced by the droplet-jet mode of near-field electrospinning. Also, it is found that the coiling diameter, wavelength, and frequency can be controlled by the droplet size as one of the process parameters in the droplet-jet mode. The droplet-jet mode will be a promising near-field electrospinning technique to apply direct-written nanofibers to various micro-scale applications.},

This study also investigates the mechanical strength and piezoelectric characteristics of a single PVDF/MWCNT nanofiber. The morphology and polarization intensity of piezoelectric fiber can be controlled by adjusting the traveling velocity of the X-Y stage, the DC voltage, and the gap between the needle and collection plate. The optimal parameters of the PVDF solution, such as the PVDF powder weight percentage and MWCNT content, were also determined. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows a high diffraction peak at 2$\theta$ = 20.8° in the piezoelectric crystal $\beta$-phase structure. ANSYS finite element analysis (FEA) software with coupled field analysis was used to realize piezoelectric actuation behavior of the PVDF fibers. A nano-indentation test (NanoIndenter XP System, MTS co.) was used to investigate Young's modulus of the PVDF fiber. Finally, the fixed-fixed beam structures of PVDF composite fibers were tested using a DC voltage supply. Comparing the polarized fiber with non-polarized fibers, the measurement of the center displacements as a function of electric field was conducted and characterized. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We present a method for controlled deposition of oriented polymeric nanofibres. The method uses a microfabricated scanned tip as an electrospinning source. The tip is dipped in a polymer solution to gather a droplet as a source material. A voltage applied to the tip causes the formation of a Taylor cone, and at sufficiently high voltages, a polymer jet is extracted from the droplet. By moving the source relative to a surface, acting as a counter-electrode, oriented nanofibres can be deposited and integrated with microfabricated surface structures. For example, we deposited fibres of polyethylene oxide with diameters ranging from 100 to 1800 nm, with the diameter primarily depending on the concentration of the polymeric solution. In addition to the uniform fibre deposition, the scanning tip electrospinning source can produce self-assembled composite fibres of micro- and nanoparticles aligned in a polymeric fibre. We also deposited oriented conductive polymeric fibres of polyaniline and investigated the conductivity of these fibres as components for polymeric nanoelectronics.},

abstract = {Electrospinning is a popular method for creating random, non-woven fibrous templates for biomedical applications, and a subtype technique termed near-field electrospinning (NFES) was devised by reducing the air gap distance to millimeters. This decreased working distance paired with precise translational motion between the fiber source and collector allows for the direct writing of fibers. We demonstrate a near-field electrospinning device designed from a MakerFarm Prusa i3v three-dimensional (3D) printer to write polydioxanone (PDO) microfibers. PDO fiber diameters were characterized over the processing parameters: Air gap, polymer concentration, translational velocity, needle gauge, and applied voltage. Fiber crystallinity and individual fiber uniformity were evaluated for the polymer concentration and translational fiber deposition velocity. Fiber stacking was evaluated for the creation of 3D templates to guide the alignment of human gingival fibroblasts. The fiber diameters correlated positively with polymer concentration, applied voltage, and needle gauge; and inversely correlated with translational velocity and air gap distance. Individual fiber diameter variability decreases, and crystallinity increases with increasing translational fiber deposition velocity. These data resulted in the creation of tailored PDO 3D templates, which guided the alignment of primary human fibroblast cells. Together, these results suggest that NFES of PDO can be scaled to create precise geometries with tailored fiber diameters for biomedical applications.},

abstract = {Porous electrospun poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL) fibres were produced through a non-solvent induced phase separation mechanism, using binary solvent systems with different properties. The effect of the solvent properties on the size and surface morphology of electrospun PCL fibres was investigated. Chloroform (CF), dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and formic acid (FA) were used as good solvents in mixtures with a poor solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), in order to generate pores on the fibre surface. The production of porous, bead free fibres with an average diameter ranging from 1470 to 2270 nm was achieved using 12.5{\%} w/v PCL in CF/DMSO solution with good/poor solvent ratios varying from 75{\%} to 90{\%} v/v at the applied voltage of 15 kV, a spinning distance of 20 cm, and the feed flow rate of 1 ml/h. DCM and THF were proven to be less suitable good solvents for the process due to the formation of a solid skin on the jet surface, caused by the limited diffusivity of the polymer molecules from the jet surface to the liquid core and its subsequent collapse. FA was found to be unsuitable due to its similar evaporation rate to DMSO. The pore formation was favoured at high good/poor solvent ratios, whereas, the production of fibres with ribbon cross sections or fibres with beads was more pronounced at low good/poor solvent ratios. Data fitting was used for the development of a second order polynomial equation, correlating the produced fibre average diameter to the solution parameters (conductivity, surface tension, and viscosity), for the given polymer and solvent systems, under the specific experimental conditions used in this study. The ternary mixture compositions that lead to the formation of porous fibres were mapped on a ternary graph.},

Imine-linked macrocycles were recently found to assemble into high-aspect ratio ({\textgreater}10 3), lyotropic nanotubes in the presence of excess acid. Yet these harsh conditions are incompatible with many functional groups and processing methods, and lower acid loadings instead catalyze macrocycle degradation. Here we report pyridine-2,6-diimine-linked macrocycles that assemble into high-aspect ratio nanotubes in the presence of less than 1 equiv of CF3CO2H per macrocycle. Analysis by gel permeation chromatography and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed a cooperative self-assembly mechanism. Nanofibers obtained by touch-spinning the pyridinium-based nanotubes exhibit Young's mod-uli of 1.48 GPa, which exceeds that of many synthetic polymers and biological filaments. These findings will enable the design of structurally diverse nanotubes from synthetically accessible macrocycles.},

It is shown that the working distance and fibre collector speed have a more significant influence on the deposition of a single jet than the flow rate. In the case of a compound jet, it is shown that jet deposition onto aluminium foil results in a linear fibre form, but on glass slides it appears as a random fibre network. The fabrication of aligned and patterned core-shell structured fibres is demonstrated by coaxial electrospinning of sugar and polycaprolactone (PCL) solutions. Aligned sugar-PCL core-shell fibres with diameters of ∼1.2 $\mu$m are deposited on an x-y translation stage, 10 cm below the coaxial spinneret.

abstract = {In this study, a cylindrical near-field electrospinning (CNFES) process was used to fabricate poly($\gamma$-benzyl $\alpha$, l-glutamate) (PBLG) fibers with permanent piezoelectricity. To analyze the piezoelectricity of various PBLG fibers, PBLG weight percentage, rotating tangential speed, electric field, and fiber diameter were investigated. The average diameter of the electrospun PBLG fiber is in the range from 4.37 to 25 $\mu$m with the optimum parameters (PBLG concentration: 18 wt{\%}, tangential collection velocity: 942.4778 mm/s, and electric field: 6×10 6 V/m). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to characterize PBLG nonwoven fiber fabrics (NFFs) made by the CNFES process. The PBLG NFFs with high absorption peak at 1650 cm −1 corresponding to $\alpha$-helix piezoelectric structures were demonstrated. In the experiment, the electrical energy output of one single PBLG fiber was characterized. The maximum power output is 138.42 pW with a load resistance of 8 MΩ. However, one single polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fiber was also tested under the same condition and measurement. The power output is up to 265.81 pW with a load resistance of 6 MΩ. The results show that the power generation of the PVDF fibers exceeds that of PBLG fibers by 68{\%}.},

abstract = {One-dimensional piezoelectric nanomaterials have attracted great attention in recent years for their possible applications in mechanical energy scavenging devices. However, it is difficult to control the structural diameter, length, and density of these fibers fabricated by micro/nano-technologies. This work presents a hollow cylindrical near-field electrospinning (HCNFES) process to address production and performance issues encountered previously in either far-field electrospinning (FFES) or near-field electrospinning (NFES) processes. Oriented polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibers in the form of nonwoven fabric have been directly written on a glass tube for aligned piezoelectricity. Under a high in situ electrical poling field and strong mechanical stretching (the tangential speed on the glass tube collector is about 1989.3 mm s −1), the HCNFES process is able to uniformly deposit large arrays of PVDF fibers with good concentrations of piezoelectric $\beta$-phase. The nonwoven fiber fabric (NFF) is transferred onto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate and fixed at both ends using copper foil electrodes as a flexible textile-fiber-based PVDF energy harvester. Repeated stretching and releasing of PVDF NFF with a strain of 0.05{\%} at 7 Hz produces a maximum peak voltage and current at 76 mV and 39 nA, respectively.},

abstract = {Electrohydrodynamic direct-writing (EDW) is a developing technology for high-resolution printing. How to decrease the line width and improve the deposition accuracy of direct-written patterns has been the key to the promotion for the further application of EDW. In this paper, an airflow-assisted spinneret for electrohydrodynamic direct-writing was designed. An assisted laminar airflow was introduced to the EDW process, which provided an additional stretching and constraining force on the jet to reduce the surrounding interferences and enhance jet stability. The flow field and the electric field around the spinneret were simulated to direct the structure design of the airflow-assisted spinneret. Then, a series of experiments were conducted, and the results verified the spinneret design and demonstrated a stable ejection of jet in the EDW process. With assisted airflow, the uniformity of printed patterns and the deposition position accuracy of a charged jet can be improved. Complex patterns with positioning errors of less than 5{\%} have been printed and characterized, which provide an effective way to promote the integration of micro/nanosystems.},

abstract = {Electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) is a key research area for producing micro and nano-sized structures. This process can be categorized into two main operating regimes: electrospraying for particle generation and electrospinning for fibre production. Producing particles/fibres of the desired size or morphology depends on two main factors; properties of the polymeric solution used and the processing conditions including flow rate, applied voltage and collection distance. In this work the particle-fibre transition region was analyzed by changing the polymer concentration of PLGA poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) in acetone between 2 and 25 wt{\%}. Subsequently the processing conditions were adjusted to study the optimum transition parameters. Additionally the EHDA configuration was also modified by adding a metallic plate to observe the deposition area. The diameter and the distance of the plate from the capillary tip were adjusted to investigate variations in particle and fibre morphologies as well. It was found that complete transition from particles to fibres occurs at 20 wt{\%} indicating concentration to be the dominant criterion. Low flow rates yielded fibres without beads. However the applied voltage and distance between the tip of the nozzle jetting the polymer solution and collector (working distance) did not yield definitive results. Reducing the collector distance and increasing applied voltages produces smooth as well as beaded fibres. Addition of a metal plate reduces particle size by ∼ 1 $\mu$m; the fibre size increases especially with increasing plate diameter while bead density and size reduces when the disc is fixed closer to the capillary tip. Additionally, the deposition area is reduced by 70{\%} and 57{\%} with the addition of metal plates of 30 mm and 60 mm, respectively. The results indicate that a metal plate can be utilized further to tune the particle/fibre size and morphology and this also significantly increases the yield of EHDA process which is currently a limitation in adopting it as a mass production technique.},

Nanochannels were fabricated monolithically through three main steps: 1) direct-writing nanofiber arrays onto a silicon substrate using NFES, 2) PDMS molding of the prescribed nanofibers patterns, and 3) plasma treating PDMS substrate to promote the adhesion and bonding process. The nanochannels fabricated in this study had channel widths ranging from 500 to 1300 nm and depths of 70 to 500 nm, and were patterned in a fashion similar to the wire bonding process routinely used in the semiconductor industry. The nanochannel dimensions were predominantly dictated by electrospun nanofibers, showing that NFES is capable of depositing nanofibers with a diameter down to -50 nm. Results show that reliable and repeatable nanofluidic channel arrays were speedily fabricated at a very low cost, while nanofluidic patterns and dimensions are predominantly controlled by NFES in a directwrite, addressable manner. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

Their electrospun nanocomposites showed linear morphology with the drug presented in an amorphous state. The loaded cargoes could be released from the nanocomposites simultaneously when they were placed in the dissolution media, showing faster dissolution rates than their counterparts (physical mixtures).

abstract = {Electrospinning is a powerful method for preparing porous materials that can be applied as biomedical materials for implantation or tissue engineering or as scaffolds for 3D cell culture experiments. However, this technique is limited in practical applications because the pore size of 3D scaffolds directly prepared by conventional electrospinning is usually less than several tens of micrometres, which may not be suitable for 3D cell culture and tissue growth. To allow for satisfactory 3D cell culture and tissue engineering, the pore size of the scaffold should be controllable according to the requirement of the specific cells to be cultured. Here, we show that layer-structured scaffolds with pore sizes larger than 100 $\mu$m can be obtained by stacking meshes prepared by direct-writing using the near-field electrospinning (NFES) technique. In the study, we prepared composite scaffolds made of polycaprolactone (PCL) and hydroxyapatite (HAp) via the above-mentioned method and tested the effectiveness of the novel scaffold in cell culture using mouse pre-osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1). The pore size and the degradability of the PCL/HAp scaffolds were characterized. The results showed that the average pore size of the scaffolds was 167 $\mu$m, which was controllable based on the required application; the degradation rate was controllable depending on the ratio of PCL to HAp. The biocompatibility of the scaffolds in vitro was studied, and it was found that the scaffolds showed no toxicity and that the cells could effectively attach, proliferate, and differentiate in the 3D skeleton of the scaffolds. Our studies showed that a simple modification of the preparation procedure can lead to a new way to fabricate novel layer-structured 3D scaffolds with controllable structures and pore sizes suitable for practical applications in implantation, tissue engineering and 3D cell culture.},

abstract = {A simple patterning process combining near-field electrospinning (NFE) and template lithography, called near-field electrospinning-assisted lithography (NFEAL), was developed to prepare polymeric scaffolds with microgroove patterns for potential use in biomedical applications. NFE enabled the deposition of poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) fibers at a desired position. The diameters of the deposited PEO fibers could be controlled over a range of 0.5–20 $\mu$m by adjusting the NFE parameters such as voltage, distance, feed rate, and translation speed. The preparation of PEO fibers with 1 and 3 $\mu$m diameters using NFE, followed by the deposition of polystyrene (PS) and removal of the fiber template, created free-standing PS scaffolds with microgroove patterns. The width of the microgroove was similar to the diameter of the PEO fibers. The depth of the microgroove was also dependent on the dimensions of the PEO fibers; microgrooves of depth 64.49 ± 11.5 nm and 216.68 ± 62.9 nm were fabricated from PEO fibers of diameters 1 and 3 $\mu$m, respectively. When C2C12 cells were cultured on the microgrooved scaffolds, they showed enhanced elongation or alignment along the microgrooved scaffolds, especially, for the microgroove (1 $\mu$m) with a smaller width.},

abstract = {Micro/nano serpentine structures have widespread applications in flexible/stretchable electronics; however, challenges still exist for low-cost, high-efficiency and controllable manufacturing. Helix electrohydrodynamic printing (HE-printing) has been proposed here to realize controllable direct-writing of large area, highly aligned serpentine micro/nanofibers by introducing the rope coiling effect into printing process. By manipulating the flying trajectory and solidification degree of the micro/nano jet, the solidified micro/nanofiber flying in a stabilized helical manner and versatile serpentine structures deposited on a moving collector have been achieved. Systematic experiments and theoretical analysis were conducted to study the transformation behavior and the size changing rules for various deposited microstructures, and highly aligned serpentine microfibers were directly written by controlling the applied voltage, nozzle-to-collector distance and collector velocity. Furthermore, a hyper-stretchable piezoelectric device that can detect stretching, bending and pressure has been successfully fabricated using the printed serpentine micro/nanofibers, demonstrating the potential of HE-printing in stretchable electronics manufacturing.},

abstract = {Cellular behavior is strongly influenced by the architecture and pattern of its interfacing extracellular matrix (ECM). For an artificial culture system which could eventually benefit the translation of scientific findings into therapeutic development, the system should capture the key characteristics of a physiological microenvironment. At the same time, it should also enable standardized, high throughput data acquisition. Since an ECM is composed of different fibrous proteins, studying cellular interaction with individual fibrils will be of physiological relevance. In this study, we employ near-field electrospinning to create ordered patterns of collagenous fibrils of gelatin, based on an acetic acid and ethyl acetate aqueous co-solvent system. Tunable conformations of micro-fibrils were directly deposited onto soft polymeric substrates in a single step. We observe that global topographical features of straight lines, beads-on-strings, and curls are dictated by solution conductivity; whereas the finer details such as the fiber cross-sectional profile are tuned by solution viscosity. Using these fibril constructs as cellular assays, we study EA.hy926 endothelial cells' response to ROCK inhibition, because of ROCK's key role in the regulation of cell shape. The fibril array was shown to modulate the cellular morphology towards a pre-capillary cord-like phenotype, which was otherwise not observed on a flat 2-D substrate. Further facilitated by quantitative analysis of morphological parameters, the fibril platform also provides better dissection in the cells' response to a H1152 ROCK inhibitor. In conclusion, the near-field electrospun fibril constructs provide a more physiologically-relevant platform compared to a featureless 2-D surface, and simultaneously permit statistical single-cell image cytometry using conventional microscopy systems. The patterning approach described here is also expected to form the basics for depositing other protein fibrils, seen among potential applications as culture platforms for drug screening.},

Metal oxides nanostructuration, preparation with the various morphologies, and their coupling with other structures enhance the unique properties of the materials and open new perspectives for their application in the food industry. Chemical gas sensors that are based on semiconducting metal oxide materials can detect the presence of toxins and volatile organic compounds that are produced in food products due to their spoilage and hazardous processes that may take place during the food aging and transportation. Metal oxide nanomaterials can be used in food processing, packaging, and the preservation industry as well. Moreover, the metal oxide-based nanocomposite structures can provide many advantageous features to the final food packaging material, such as antimicrobial activity, enzyme immobilization, oxygen scavenging, mechanical strength, increasing the stability and the shelf life of food, and securing the food against humidity, temperature, and other physiological factors. In this paper, we review the most recent achievements on the synthesis of metal oxide-based nanostructures and their applications in food quality monitoring and active and intelligent packaging.},

abstract = {Near-field electrospinning (NFES) had better controllability than conventional electrospinning. However, due to the lack of guidance of theoretical model, precise deposition of micro/nano fibers could only accomplished by experience. To analyze the behavior of charged jet in NFES using mathematical model, the momentum balance equation was simplified and a new expression between jet cross-sectional radius and axial position was derived. Using this new expression and mass conservation equation, expressions for jet cross-sectional radius and velocity were derived in terms of axial position and initial jet acceleration in the form of exponential functions. Based on Slender-body theory and Giesekus model, a quadratic equation for initial jet acceleration was acquired. With the proposed model, it was able to accurately predict the diameter and velocity of polymer fibers in NFES, and mathematical analysis rather than experimental methods could be applied to study the effects of the process parameters in NFES. Moreover, the movement velocity of the collector stage can be regulated by mathematical model rather than experience. Therefore, the model proposed in this paper had important guiding significance to precise deposition of polymer fibers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).},

Using a combination of annealing thermal treatment and the wet chemical etching of metal layer a flexible transparent electrode is prepared. Using this high speed and large-area printing technique we can overcome the drawbacks of conventional electrospinning such as fiber structural inhomogeneity, random orientation, and non-reproducible results. In addition, the application of more complicated and expensive methods such as lithography or e-beam lithography or nanoimprint lithography can be avoided using this technique. The most important advantage of the reported fabrication method relative to electro-spinning process is the ability to have a special control on the distribution pattern of the electrodes on the surface which can lead to better control over the ratio of conductivity and transparency of the surface.},

A set of experiments have been conducted on solutions of polycaprolactone (PCL) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Parameters of interest are voltage, standoff distance, polymer concentration, environmental condition and needle size. From the experimental results, polymer concentration, environmental condition and needle size had influence on achieving a small cylindrical fibre. Under near-field deposition, the concentration should be high, the needle should be small and the temperature should be maintained during the process.},

Although NFES could eliminate the bending instability effect by shortening tip-to-collector distance (TTCD) less than the critical length, reported patterns up to the date have been limited to simply aligned straight-lines because of the ignorance of the importance of jet impact speed. To realize the jet impact speed for precise microscale patterning, experimental study of the effect of the process parameters such as applied voltage, TTCD, and an electric field was performed. It has been found that lowering the applied voltage and the TTCD simultaneously could reduce the jet impact speed while keeping the process stable and continuous, resulting in considerable improvement of the accuracy of the deposition. Having the ability to control jet impact speed in NFES will provide the essential foundation to broaden applications of NFES to micro and nanoscale engineering such as an optical waveguide, customized cell culture matrix fabrication to name a few.},

abstract = {A lthough electrospinning (ES) allows the production of unsurpassed nanoscale polymer fibers, the major drawbacks are the nozzle-clogging and single-jet spinneret, respectively. This is a real limitation in terms of usable polymers and for patterning active organics. Nowadays the micro-engineering of smart materials could represent a new route for many fields of technology ranging from the production of electronic and photonic devices 1−3 to regener-ative medicine and tissue engineering. 4−7 An enormous technological interest is related to the possibility of patterning fibers directly in well-ordered patterns avoiding the deposition of nonwoven submicrometer mats often occurring in ES. 8,9 In the past decade several attempts have been made using field-induced 10−13 and near-field ES, 14,15 but only very recently, with the introduction of mechano ES, 16 has the production of well-ordered fiber patterns been achieved. Nevertheless, some drawbacks related to the complexity of the setup, the operating temperature, and the selection of usable materials for problems related to nozzle clogging still persist. Moreover, high temperature can cause deterioration of the optical and electronic properties of active organic materials eventually embedded in the functionalized fibers. On the other side, interfering effects due to closeness of multiple electrified nozzles ban working with multiple spinnerets. Here we introduce a revolutionary nozzle-free approach, the tethered pyro-electrodynamic spinning (TPES) operating in wireless modality, i.e., without electric circuit, electrodes, and voltage supply. This novel approach definitively simplifies the ES apparatus extending the nanofiber spinning also to active organic polymers preserving at the same time all the properties of conventional systems. Fiber drawing from the liquid polymer is driven through the pyroelectric charge generated into a ferroelectric crystal (i.e., LiNbO 3) able to induce the electro-hydrodynamics (EHD) pressure required for polymer manipulation without wires. The approach is highly flexible, simple, compact, and cost-effective when compared with classical ES, and last but not least, it allows working safely, avoiding the use of high-voltage equipment at kVolts scale. For the first time, in situ observation of fiber drawing is provided allowing real-time adjustments and full control of the process. Moreover the TPES adds to the capabilities of conventional ES the chance of printing polymer fibers even in the case of multiple drops opening the way to the multijetting spinneret modality for multiplexing and speeding up the fabrication process. Printing of micro-and nanofibers directly from a polymer drop with unprecedented order, direct writing of sharp/straight edges, and easy multijets electrospinning are demonstrated and reported. Experimental fabrication of patterns embedded with active molecules ensures that functionalized patterns preserve their functionalities after the TPES process. Results regarding the use of smart patterns for keeping alive and viable cultured cells are discussed. This study opens the way to innovative optogenesys analysis, guiding light for generating or transporting optical/electronic signals from and to cells. 17−21 The setup proposed in this work, unlike the conventional ES, is electrode-free and nozzle-free, Figure 1a,b. The method allows polymer nanofibers to be printed directly from a polymer drop overpassing the viscosity border of nozzle clogging in conventional inkjet systems. 22 The drop reservoir is placed directly on a flat substrate (base) while an electric field, Figure 1.

@article{Zheng2014,
abstract = {AC pulse-modulated electrohydrodynamic direct-writing (EDW) was utilized to direct-write orderly micro/nanofibrous structure on the flexible insulating polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. During the EDW process, AC electrical field induced charges to reciprocate along the jet and decreased the charge repulsive force that applied on charged jet. Thanks to the smaller charge repulsive force, stable straight jet can be built up to direct-write orderly micro/nanofibrous structures on the insulating substrate. The minimum motion velocity required to direct-write straight line fibrous structure on insulating PET substrate was 700 mm/s. Moreover, the influences of AC voltage amplitude, frequency, and duty cycle ratio on the line width of fibrous structures were investigated. This work proposes a novel solution to overcome the inherent charge repulsion emerging on the insulating substrate, and promotes the application of EDW technology on the flexible electronics.},

Anatase TiO2 with crystallites' size of approximately 12 nm have been prepared and characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS techniques. Experimental measurements have been conducted through an ad hoc analog integrated resistive sensor interface, based on an oscillating circuit, fabricated in a 0.35 $\mu$m standard CMOS technology. Gas response to NO2 in the range 1-10 ppm and 100-300°C operating temperature (OT) has shown best practical sensor sensitivity (S = RG/RA) at a relatively low OT (150°C) and detection limits down to 1 ppm gas. Nitrogen doping at N:Ti 1:1 atomic ratio has been proposed in order to decrease the intrinsic resistance of TiO2, thus enabling better signal to noise ratio of the electrical response. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In electrospinning process, polymer nanofibers are formed with diameters in the submicron scale when a drop of viscoelastic polymer solution is subjected to a high voltage electrostatic field, when the charge force overcomes the surface tension of the solution, a beam is projected onto a collector. Among other parameters, the rheological properties of the polymer solution can significantly influence fiber formation during the electrospinning process, although this is well known, there is still no clear understanding of the effect of these properties to form fibers with morphology and structure consistent and controlled. The study was conducted for a system of SU-8 2002 (an epoxy-based negative photoresist) dissolved in cyclopentanone with poly(ethylene) oxide, PEO, and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate, TBATFB, as additives. The fibers were electrospun in an Electro Mechanical Spinning, EMS, platform. The rheological properties of the polymer solution were studied under shear conditions and combined with oscillatory data to get uniaxial deformation behavior using the Wagner constitutive equation. The elongational viscosity in the projected beam is estimated by using data from oscillatory tests. For this purpose, solutions of SU-8 2002 were tested and then electrospun systematically over a range of concentrations. It was found that the variation in concentration of the additives modifies the viscoelastic properties of the solutions and, therefore, the electrospinnability. As PEO concentration is increased the complex, elongational and shear viscosity also increases. For concentrations of TBATFB, the variation of the viscosities has not a clear behavior pattern. The most regular and thinnest fibers were those obtained from a concentration of 99.5, 0.25 and 0.25 wt percent. of SU-8 2002, PEO and TBATFB respectively. With the acquired information, process variables for the EMS such as fabrication velocity, voltage and tip-to-collector distance were improved.},

abstract = {Over the last couple of decades, Carbon Nanowires (CNWs) have found important applications in the field of rapid label-free biosensing platforms for their excellent electrical, thermal and chemical properties. Despite the growing interest in incorporating these materials into sensitive analytical devices, there has been limited research efforts that explore the realistic incorporation of these structures into broader microsystems. The present dissertation explores two Advanced Additive Manufacturing (AdAM) techniques for the fabrication of CNWs with promising characteristics for sensing applications. The first technique, Electro-Mechanical Spinning (EMS) is a relatively new method for the production of CNWs with highly-oriented patterning capabilities, and is assessed in terms of the minimum feature sizes that it can attain reproducibly. The second method, Multiple Photon Polymerization (MPP) is a mature laser manufacturing technique that offers high repeatability, yet it has remained largely unexplored in the field of carbon materials. This work presents a study of how MPP can be used to create CNWs in terms of micro-fabrication parameters like laser power and scanning velocity. A thorough review study of the surface properties required for carbon materials to become eligible candidates in biosensing is also included in this dissertation. Lastly, an application of CNWs is presented, in which a Joule Heating technique is used to induce controlled breaking of the wires to produce nano-scale separated carbon electrodes, which hold potential for micro/nano particle manipulation in microfluidics.},

Before the onset of electrospinning, a bias voltage is applied to a semispherical shaped polymer droplet outside of a syringe needle, and a probe tip mechanically draws a single fiber from the droplet to initiate continuous NFES. Contrary to the conventional electrospinning process, we show that decreasing electrical field in continuous NFES results in smaller linewidth deposition, and nanofibers can be assembled into controlled complex patterns such as circular shapes and grid arrays on large and flat areas. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

We demonstrate that this shrinkage and elongation during pyrolysis strongly influences the resulting carbon electrical properties. Compared to fibers that retained their length during pyrolysis, conductivity was enhanced by a factor of seven after fibers were elongated four times their initial pre-pyrolysis length with a concurrent shrinkage of their diameter by half. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
