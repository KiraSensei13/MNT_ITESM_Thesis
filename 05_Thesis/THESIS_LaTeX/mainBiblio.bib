abstract = {Over the last couple of decades, Carbon Nanowires (CNWs) have found important applications in the field of rapid label-free biosensing platforms for their excellent electrical, thermal and chemical properties. Despite the growing interest in incorporating these materials into sensitive analytical devices, there has been limited research efforts that explore the realistic incorporation of these structures into broader microsystems. The present dissertation explores two Advanced Additive Manufacturing (AdAM) techniques for the fabrication of CNWs with promising characteristics for sensing applications. The first technique, Electro-Mechanical Spinning (EMS) is a relatively new method for the production of CNWs with highly-oriented patterning capabilities, and is assessed in terms of the minimum feature sizes that it can attain reproducibly. The second method, Multiple Photon Polymerization (MPP) is a mature laser manufacturing technique that offers high repeatability, yet it has remained largely unexplored in the field of carbon materials. This work presents a study of how MPP can be used to create CNWs in terms of micro-fabrication parameters like laser power and scanning velocity. A thorough review study of the surface properties required for carbon materials to become eligible candidates in biosensing is also included in this dissertation. Lastly, an application of CNWs is presented, in which a Joule Heating technique is used to induce controlled breaking of the wires to produce nano-scale separated carbon electrodes, which hold potential for micro/nano particle manipulation in microfluidics.},

abstract = {Light-assisted 3D direct-printing of biomaterials and cellular-scaffolds has the potential to develop novel lab-on-a-chip devices (LOCs) for a variety of biomedical applications, from drug discovery and diagnostic testing to in vitro tissue engineering and regeneration. Direct-writing describes a broad family of fabrication methods that typically employ computer-controlled translational stages to manufacture structures at multi-length scales. This review focuses on light-assisted direct-write fabrication for generating 3D functional scaffolds with precise micro- and nano-architecture, using both synthetic as well as naturally derived biomaterials. Two bioprinting approaches are discussed in detail - projection printing and laser-based systems - where each method is capable of modulating multiple scaffold parameters, such as 3D architecture, mechanical properties (e.g. stiffness), Poisson's ratio, chemical gradients, biological cell distributions, and porosity. The light-assisted direct-writing techniques described in this review provide the reader with alternative approaches to fabricate 3D biomaterials for utility in LOCs.},

abstract = {In electrospinning process, polymer nanofibers are formed with diameters in the submicron scale when a drop of viscoelastic polymer solution is subjected to a high voltage electrostatic field, when the charge force overcomes the surface tension of the solution, a beam is projected onto a collector. Among other parameters, the rheological properties of the polymer solution can significantly influence fiber formation during the electrospinning process, although this is well known, there is still no clear understanding of the effect of these properties to form fibers with morphology and structure consistent and controlled. The study was conducted for a system of SU-8 2002 (an epoxy-based negative photoresist) dissolved in cyclopentanone with poly(ethylene) oxide, PEO, and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate, TBATFB, as additives. The fibers were electrospun in an Electro Mechanical Spinning, EMS, platform. The rheological properties of the polymer solution were studied under shear conditions and combined with oscillatory data to get uniaxial deformation behavior using the Wagner constitutive equation. The elongational viscosity in the projected beam is estimated by using data from oscillatory tests. For this purpose, solutions of SU-8 2002 were tested and then electrospun systematically over a range of concentrations. It was found that the variation in concentration of the additives modifies the viscoelastic properties of the solutions and, therefore, the electrospinnability. As PEO concentration is increased the complex, elongational and shear viscosity also increases. For concentrations of TBATFB, the variation of the viscosities has not a clear behavior pattern. The most regular and thinnest fibers were those obtained from a concentration of 99.5, 0.25 and 0.25 wt percent. of SU-8 2002, PEO and TBATFB respectively. With the acquired information, process variables for the EMS such as fabrication velocity, voltage and tip-to-collector distance were improved.},

It is shown that scattering on a short-range potential (e.g. due to neutral impurities) is mostly irrelevant for electronic quality of graphene, which is likely to be controlled by charged impurities and ripples (microscopic corrugations of a graphene sheet). The latter are an inherent feature of graphene due to its two-dimensional nature and can also be an important factor in defining the electron mean-free path. We show that certain types of ripples create a long-range scattering potential, similar to Coulomb scatterers, and result in charge-carrier mobility practically independent of carrier concentration, in agreement with experimental observations. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

Even as students increasingly demand trigger warnings and “safe spaces,” many young people are quick to police the words and deeds of others, who in turn claim that political correctness has run amok. Interestingly, members of both camps often consider themselves victims of the other.

A Scanning Electron Microscope study showed that carbon nanotubes were all vertically aligned with respect to the substrate, with diameters ranging from 10 nm to 200 nm. Different sizes of Ni catalyst particles were observed on the tips of carbon nanotubes. Transmission Electron Microscopy was used to study the morphology of the grown tubes and the results obtained show that the diameters and structures of these carbon nanotubes were closely correlated to the sizes and structures of the Ni nanoparticies. Two main structures namely bamboo shaped carbon nanotubes and herringbone shaped carbon nanofibres were found on the same sample.

The CNWs are highly branched at the nanoscale, and novel hierarchical microstructures with CNWs connected to a solid amorphous core are made by controlling the plasma treatment time. By multilayer processing we demonstrate deterministic joining of CNW micropillars into 3D sensing networks.

Traditional sensors are being re-engineered and recast from the nanotechnology perspective, and new sensor designs are being introduced. Sensitivity, detection range and response time of sensors have been remarkably ameliorated by using nanotechnological methods. Faster, better, cheaper and smaller sensors are becoming available. Sensor development in the nanotechnology age, the focal theme of this book, is one of the hottest topics in contemporary research. The book presents a critical appraisal of the new opportunities provided by nanotechnologies, and the nanotechnology-enabled advancements in the field of sensors. Being a new topic, information on nanosensors is scattered in research journals and reports. There is a paucity of books in this area. This book is intended to fill this long-felt need. Bringing together the widely spread information between the covers of an easy-to-read book will be helpful to all those working on nanosensors for instant reference and knowledge update"-- 1.

@book{Marsh1989,
abstract = {This Chapter is principally concerned with the major topics associated with the conversion of coal to coke. Only a limited range of coal rank i.e. the bituminous coals, produce acceptable metallurgical cokes. The history of coke making is briefly reviewed followed by description of a coke battery and the by-products of coking. Theories of carbonization are abundant but current knowledge of liquid crystal theory has done much to expand the understanding of the origin of cokes and their properties. Coal Rank, Type and Grade are properties used in coal classification for coke making. The coking of a single coal particle and the development of the coke cenosphere are described. The importance of the plastic (fluid) layer, developed within the coal charge in the slot coke oven, is high-lighted including the thermal transformation of coal macerals to coke components. In industrial practice, the ability to predict coke strength or mechanical stability from properties of coal blends is of obvious importance. Much has been done to analyse coke structure in terms of optical microscopy of polished sections, i.e. coke petrography. This exhibits the various isotropic and anisotropic components of coke structure. Cokes from different coal blends have different contents of anisotropic shapes, 0.5 to {\textgreater}25.0 $\mu$m in size, arising from the heterogeneous nature of the plastic (fluid) phase of carbonization from which the liquid crystal structures develop. Classifications of anisotropy are listed. The Chapter continues with descriptions of porosity and pore wall structures in cokes. Carbonization variables relate to final coke property. The behaviour of coke in the blast furnace, including discussions of reactivity, aspects of formed coke, pre-heating and co-carbonization conclude the Chapter.},

The diameter of gold nanorods (GNRs) is about 10 nm and the average aspect ratio is 6.5. In addition, we systematically investigate their nonlinear optical responses by using open-aperture Z-scan technique. In contrast with graphene and GNRs, the G@GNRs nanocomposites exhibit excellent nonlinear optical response with a modulation depth of about 51{\%} and a saturable intensity of about 6.23 GW/cm 2 . The results suggest that the G@GNRs nanocomposites could potentially be used as an optical modulator in pulsed laser generation.},

@article{Kundu2019,
abstract = {Planar microsupercapacitors are emerging as essential devices for rapid energy sourcing in on-chip circuitry. A serious limitation in comparison to planar microbatteries is the energy density that a planar supercapacitor can offer (∼two orders less), which in turn relates to the maximum working potential of the electrolyte used in it, which is typically below 3 V. In this article, we report the fabrication of a planar supercapacitor with an operating voltage window, highest among the reported till date. The electrolyte used is essentially a solid in the form of nanofibres of a supramolecular donor-acceptor assembly, consisting of coronene tetracarboxylate salt (CS) and dodecyl methyl viologen (DMV), carrying positive (K+) and negative (Br−) ionic charges, respectively. The fibres are drop-spread across Ti microgap electrodes and the device is operated in the ambient or in a humidity-controlled cell. The device is found stable up to a working potential window of 8 V, exhibiting areal capacitance values of 0.2 mF/cm2 under room humidity conditions (RH, 65{\%}) which was enhanced to 9.5 mF/cm2 under 90{\%} RH in presence of hygroscopic KBr crystallites. The estimated areal energy and power density values are remarkable, 85 $\mu$Wh cm−2 and 24.7 W cm−2 respectively. The device retained 86{\%} capacitance even after 50000 charge-discharge cycles. Using a single device, AC line filtering is shown possible with ripple less than 5{\%}. These extraordinary properties are borne out of the facile diffusion of ions along the 1D face-to-face arrangement of the D-A molecules in the nanofibres while the ambient oxide covered Ti surface providing the required electrochemical stability to the device.},

Some of these new materials are commercially available and are used in off the shelf products, others are important model systems for physicochemical and materials science research. However, research findings and application data are not compiled in a single work. The Springer Handbook of Nanomaterials collects description and data of materials which have dimensions on the nanoscale. The description of nanomaterials follows the interplay of structure, properties, processing and applications mainly in their solid phase. The chapters were arranged according to the classical materials-science classifications: carbon materials, metals, ceramics, composites, and biomaterials. For each part, materials structures represent different dimensionality; zero-dimensional clusters, nanoparticles and quantum dots, one-dimensional nanowires and nanotubes, and two-dimensional thin films and surfaces. Combinations cover for instance nanostructured and hybrid materials. Almost 100 leading scientists from academia and the industry were selected to write the 32 chapters and collect the physical, chemical and mechanical data. The handbook was written and compiled for professionals and practitioners, materials scientists, physicists and chemists at universities, as well as in the fields of industrial research and production. The Handbook is organized in seven parts. Part A: NanoCarbons. Part B: NanoMetals. Part C: NanoCeramics. Part D: NanoComposits. Part E: Nanoporous Materials. Part F: Organic and Biomaterilas.
