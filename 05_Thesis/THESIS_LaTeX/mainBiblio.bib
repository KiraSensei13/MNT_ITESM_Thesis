abstract = {Over the last couple of decades, Carbon Nanowires (CNWs) have found important applications in the field of rapid label-free biosensing platforms for their excellent electrical, thermal and chemical properties. Despite the growing interest in incorporating these materials into sensitive analytical devices, there has been limited research efforts that explore the realistic incorporation of these structures into broader microsystems. The present dissertation explores two Advanced Additive Manufacturing (AdAM) techniques for the fabrication of CNWs with promising characteristics for sensing applications. The first technique, Electro-Mechanical Spinning (EMS) is a relatively new method for the production of CNWs with highly-oriented patterning capabilities, and is assessed in terms of the minimum feature sizes that it can attain reproducibly. The second method, Multiple Photon Polymerization (MPP) is a mature laser manufacturing technique that offers high repeatability, yet it has remained largely unexplored in the field of carbon materials. This work presents a study of how MPP can be used to create CNWs in terms of micro-fabrication parameters like laser power and scanning velocity. A thorough review study of the surface properties required for carbon materials to become eligible candidates in biosensing is also included in this dissertation. Lastly, an application of CNWs is presented, in which a Joule Heating technique is used to induce controlled breaking of the wires to produce nano-scale separated carbon electrodes, which hold potential for micro/nano particle manipulation in microfluidics.},

Direct-writing describes a broad family of fabrication methods that typically employ computer-controlled translational stages to manufacture structures at multi-length scales. This review focuses on light-assisted direct-write fabrication for generating 3D functional scaffolds with precise micro- and nano-architecture, using both synthetic as well as naturally derived biomaterials. Two bioprinting approaches are discussed in detail - projection printing and laser-based systems - where each method is capable of modulating multiple scaffold parameters, such as 3D architecture, mechanical properties (e.g. stiffness), Poisson's ratio, chemical gradients, biological cell distributions, and porosity. The light-assisted direct-writing techniques described in this review provide the reader with alternative approaches to fabricate 3D biomaterials for utility in LOCs.},

abstract = {In electrospinning process, polymer nanofibers are formed with diameters in the submicron scale when a drop of viscoelastic polymer solution is subjected to a high voltage electrostatic field, when the charge force overcomes the surface tension of the solution, a beam is projected onto a collector. Among other parameters, the rheological properties of the polymer solution can significantly influence fiber formation during the electrospinning process, although this is well known, there is still no clear understanding of the effect of these properties to form fibers with morphology and structure consistent and controlled. The study was conducted for a system of SU-8 2002 (an epoxy-based negative photoresist) dissolved in cyclopentanone with poly(ethylene) oxide, PEO, and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate, TBATFB, as additives. The fibers were electrospun in an Electro Mechanical Spinning, EMS, platform. The rheological properties of the polymer solution were studied under shear conditions and combined with oscillatory data to get uniaxial deformation behavior using the Wagner constitutive equation. The elongational viscosity in the projected beam is estimated by using data from oscillatory tests. For this purpose, solutions of SU-8 2002 were tested and then electrospun systematically over a range of concentrations. It was found that the variation in concentration of the additives modifies the viscoelastic properties of the solutions and, therefore, the electrospinnability. As PEO concentration is increased the complex, elongational and shear viscosity also increases. For concentrations of TBATFB, the variation of the viscosities has not a clear behavior pattern. The most regular and thinnest fibers were those obtained from a concentration of 99.5, 0.25 and 0.25 wt percent. of SU-8 2002, PEO and TBATFB respectively. With the acquired information, process variables for the EMS such as fabrication velocity, voltage and tip-to-collector distance were improved.},

abstract = {We discuss various scattering mechanisms for Dirac fermions in single-layer graphene. It is shown that scattering on a short-range potential (e.g. due to neutral impurities) is mostly irrelevant for electronic quality of graphene, which is likely to be controlled by charged impurities and ripples (microscopic corrugations of a graphene sheet). The latter are an inherent feature of graphene due to its two-dimensional nature and can also be an important factor in defining the electron mean-free path. We show that certain types of ripples create a long-range scattering potential, similar to Coulomb scatterers, and result in charge-carrier mobility practically independent of carrier concentration, in agreement with experimental observations. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

These are not the familiar clashes between liberals and conservatives or the religious and the secular: instead, they are clashes between a new moral culture-victimhood culture-and a more traditional culture of dignity. Even as students increasingly demand trigger warnings and “safe spaces,” many young people are quick to police the words and deeds of others, who in turn claim that political correctness has run amok. Interestingly, members of both camps often consider themselves victims of the other. In tracking the rise of victimhood culture, Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning help to decode an often dizzying cultural milieu, from campus riots over conservative speakers and debates around free speech to the election of Donald Trump.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes with different structures were catalytically synthesized on Ni coated SiO 2/Si substrate in a Direct Current Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition system, in which C 2H 2 acted as the carbon source and NH 3 as the etchant gas. A Scanning Electron Microscope study showed that carbon nanotubes were all vertically aligned with respect to the substrate, with diameters ranging from 10 nm to 200 nm. Different sizes of Ni catalyst particles were observed on the tips of carbon nanotubes. Transmission Electron Microscopy was used to study the morphology of the grown tubes and the results obtained show that the diameters and structures of these carbon nanotubes were closely correlated to the sizes and structures of the Ni nanoparticies. Two main structures namely bamboo shaped carbon nanotubes and herringbone shaped carbon nanofibres were found on the same sample. It is suggested that by controlling the pre-growth condition, desired structure of carbon nanotubes or carbon nanofibres could be produced for practical applications.

The simplicity and scalability of this process, as well as the hierarchical organization of CNWs, provides a potential alternative to the use of carbon nanotubes and graphene for applications in microsystems and high surface area materials. The CNWs are highly branched at the nanoscale, and novel hierarchical microstructures with CNWs connected to a solid amorphous core are made by controlling the plasma treatment time. By multilayer processing we demonstrate deterministic joining of CNW micropillars into 3D sensing networks. Finally we show that these networks can be chemically functionalized and used for measurement of DNA binding with increased sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Sensitivity, detection range and response time of sensors have been remarkably ameliorated by using nanotechnological methods. Faster, better, cheaper and smaller sensors are becoming available. Sensor development in the nanotechnology age, the focal theme of this book, is one of the hottest topics in contemporary research. The book presents a critical appraisal of the new opportunities provided by nanotechnologies, and the nanotechnology-enabled advancements in the field of sensors. Being a new topic, information on nanosensors is scattered in research journals and reports. There is a paucity of books in this area. This book is intended to fill this long-felt need.

Only a limited range of coal rank i.e. the bituminous coals, produce acceptable metallurgical cokes. The history of coke making is briefly reviewed followed by description of a coke battery and the by-products of coking. Theories of carbonization are abundant but current knowledge of liquid crystal theory has done much to expand the understanding of the origin of cokes and their properties. Coal Rank, Type and Grade are properties used in coal classification for coke making. The coking of a single coal particle and the development of the coke cenosphere are described. The importance of the plastic (fluid) layer, developed within the coal charge in the slot coke oven, is high-lighted including the thermal transformation of coal macerals to coke components. In industrial practice, the ability to predict coke strength or mechanical stability from properties of coal blends is of obvious importance. Much has been done to analyse coke structure in terms of optical microscopy of polished sections, i.e. coke petrography. This exhibits the various isotropic and anisotropic components of coke structure. Cokes from different coal blends have different contents of anisotropic shapes, 0.5 to {\textgreater}25.0 $\mu$m in size, arising from the heterogeneous nature of the plastic (fluid) phase of carbonization from which the liquid crystal structures develop. Classifications of anisotropy are listed. The Chapter continues with descriptions of porosity and pore wall structures in cokes. Carbonization variables relate to final coke property. The behaviour of coke in the blast furnace, including discussions of reactivity, aspects of formed coke, pre-heating and co-carbonization conclude the Chapter.},

We fabricate graphene @ gold nanorods (G@GNRs) nanocomposites by successively using dropping and transferring methods Through SEM, Raman spectra and TEM analysis, the number of graphene layers is 6–7. The diameter of gold nanorods (GNRs) is about 10 nm and the average aspect ratio is 6.5. In addition, we systematically investigate their nonlinear optical responses by using open-aperture Z-scan technique. In contrast with graphene and GNRs, the G@GNRs nanocomposites exhibit excellent nonlinear optical response with a modulation depth of about 51{\%} and a saturable intensity of about 6.23 GW/cm 2 . The results suggest that the G@GNRs nanocomposites could potentially be used as an optical modulator in pulsed laser generation.},

abstract = {Planar microsupercapacitors are emerging as essential devices for rapid energy sourcing in on-chip circuitry. A serious limitation in comparison to planar microbatteries is the energy density that a planar supercapacitor can offer (∼two orders less), which in turn relates to the maximum working potential of the electrolyte used in it, which is typically below 3 V. In this article, we report the fabrication of a planar supercapacitor with an operating voltage window, highest among the reported till date. The electrolyte used is essentially a solid in the form of nanofibres of a supramolecular donor-acceptor assembly, consisting of coronene tetracarboxylate salt (CS) and dodecyl methyl viologen (DMV), carrying positive (K+) and negative (Br−) ionic charges, respectively. The fibres are drop-spread across Ti microgap electrodes and the device is operated in the ambient or in a humidity-controlled cell. The device is found stable up to a working potential window of 8 V, exhibiting areal capacitance values of 0.2 mF/cm2 under room humidity conditions (RH, 65{\%}) which was enhanced to 9.5 mF/cm2 under 90{\%} RH in presence of hygroscopic KBr crystallites. The estimated areal energy and power density values are remarkable, 85 $\mu$Wh cm−2 and 24.7 W cm−2 respectively. The device retained 86{\%} capacitance even after 50000 charge-discharge cycles. Using a single device, AC line filtering is shown possible with ripple less than 5{\%}. These extraordinary properties are borne out of the facile diffusion of ions along the 1D face-to-face arrangement of the D-A molecules in the nanofibres while the ambient oxide covered Ti surface providing the required electrochemical stability to the device.},

abstract = {Nanomaterials inevitably have bright prospects, but even now they play an important role in many areas of industry. Some of these new materials are commercially available and are used in off the shelf products, others are important model systems for physicochemical and materials science research. However, research findings and application data are not compiled in a single work. The Springer Handbook of Nanomaterials collects description and data of materials which have dimensions on the nanoscale. The description of nanomaterials follows the interplay of structure, properties, processing and applications mainly in their solid phase. The chapters were arranged according to the classical materials-science classifications: carbon materials, metals, ceramics, composites, and biomaterials. For each part, materials structures represent different dimensionality; zero-dimensional clusters, nanoparticles and quantum dots, one-dimensional nanowires and nanotubes, and two-dimensional thin films and surfaces. Combinations cover for instance nanostructured and hybrid materials. Almost 100 leading scientists from academia and the industry were selected to write the 32 chapters and collect the physical, chemical and mechanical data. The handbook was written and compiled for professionals and practitioners, materials scientists, physicists and chemists at universities, as well as in the fields of industrial research and production. The Handbook is organized in seven parts. Part A: NanoCarbons. Part B: NanoMetals. Part C: NanoCeramics. Part D: NanoComposits. Part E: Nanoporous Materials. Part F: Organic and Biomaterilas.

abstract = {The discovery of fullerenes (also known as buckyballs) has generated tremendous excitement and opened up a new field of carbon chemistry. As the first book available on this topic, this volume will be a landmark reference in the field. Because buckyballs are essentially closed hollow cages made up of carbon atoms, they can be manipulated in a variety of ways to yield never-before-seen materials. The balls can, for instance, be doped with atoms or pulled out into tubules and filled with lead to provide properties of high-temperature superconductivity. Researchers can now create their own buckyballs in a process that is almost as simple as making soot, making this research as inexpensive as it is exotic (which has doubtless contributed to its popularity). Researchers anticipate that fullerenes will offer boundless opportunities in the development of new products, drugs and materials.

The structural change of CNFs through KOH activation was investigated by using SEM, TEM and XRD. KOH activation was found to be effective to develop particular pore sizes on the CNF surface, increasing the surface area of CNF. The increase of surface area in KOH activation of CNF is first ascribed to local broadening of graphene interstices or local burn-off of graphenes, which limit the surface area increase of CNF with the fiber structure maintained. The activation under severe conditions caused to destroy the fiber structure of CNF. Activated CNFs were applied as an electrode for electrical double layer capacitors to be compared to active carbon fibers in terms of the surface properties. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Prepared CSCNT-dispersed CFRP laminates are subject to Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) and End Notched Flexure (ENF) tests in order to obtain mode-I and mode-II interlaminar fracture toughness. The measured fracture toughnesses are compared to that of CFRP laminates without CSCNT to evaluate the effectiveness of CSCNT dispersion for the improvement of fracture toughness. All CSCNT-dispersed CFRP laminates exhibit higher fracture toughness, and specifically, CSCNT-dispersed CFRP laminates with thin epoxy interlayers containing short CSCNTs have three times higher fracture toughness than CFRP laminates without CSCNT. SEM observation of fracture surfaces is also conducted to investigate the mechanisms of fracture toughness improvement.

abstract = {Ultrafine fibers of polyaniline doped with camphorsulfonic acid (PAn.HCSA) blended with polyethylene oxide (PEO) were prepared by a non-mechanical, electrostatic spinning (`electrospinning') technique. The morphology and fiber diameter of electrospun polyaniline blend fibers revealed that both the PEO and the PAn.HCSA/PEO blend fibers had a diameter ranging between 950 nm and 2.1 $\mu$m, with a generally uniform thickness along the fiber. The UV-visible spectra of these electrospun fibers were similar to those for cast films produced from the same solutions. As expected, the conductivity of the non-woven fiber mat, as measured by the four-point probe method, was slightly lower than that of a cast film, due to the high porosity of the non-woven mat. The rate for the vapor phase de-doping/re-doping of the electrospun fibers is at least one order of magnitude faster than for cast films, stressing the enormous effect an increase in the surface-to-volume ratio, accomplished by electrospinning the material into fibers, can have on the selected chemical properties of polyaniline blends.},

abstract = {A variety of techniques for the manufacture of biodegradable, three-dimensional scaffolds for tissue engineering have been developed in recent years. In this study, we report and compare two simple methods for fabricating poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds with feature sizes of 10-200 $\mu$m, which have been developed in our laboratories. The first technique is based on the use of a microsyringe that makes use of a computer-controlled, three-axis micropositioner, which allows the control of motor speeds and position. A PLGA solution is drawn from the needle of the syringe by the application of a constant pressure of 10-300 mm Hg resulting in controlled polymer deposition of 10-600 $\mu$m in diameter. The second technique is based on "soft lithographic" approaches that utilizes a Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) mold. The polymer solution is cast on the mold under vacuum. Polymer concentration, solvent composition, and casting conditions influence the integrity and the lateral resolution of the resulting scaffold. Both techniques allow the possibility of constructing three-dimensional architectures that permit the study of cell behaviour in an environment similar to that in vivo, and may provide tools for the construction of engineered tissue. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Possibilities of electrochemical energy conversion using carbon nanotubes and related materials in various systems, such as lithium batteries, supercapacitors, hydrogen storage, are considered. It is shown that for these applications the electrochemical properties of multiwalled (MWNTs) and single walled (SWNTs) nanotubes are essentially dominated by their mesoporous character. During lithium insertion into nanotubular materials a high irreversible capacity Cirr (from 460 to 1080 mAh/g) has been observed after the first cycle with a tendency to further decomposition of electrolyte with cycling. Penetration of solvated lithium ions in the accessible mesopores is at the origin of this phenomenon; an almost linear dependence has been found between the mesopore volume and Cirr. Reversible capacity for lithium insertion Crev ranged between 220 and 780 mAh/g; however, a great divergence (hysteresis) between insertion and extraction characteristics was observed independently on the kind of nanotubes and oxygen content. Amount of lithium stored by electrostatic attraction is negligible in comparison to real redox reactions which for thermodynamic reasons present linear variation of potential, especially during deinsertion (pseudocapacitive effects). During positive polarization, i.e., removal of lithium, resistivity of the electrode also gradually increases. Due to the open network of mesopores formed by the nanotubes entanglement, and consequently an easily accessible electrode-electrolyte interface, nanotubular materials are quite adapted for supercapacitor electrodes in various electrolytic solutions. High values of capacitance (80 F/g) have been obtained in 6 M KOH for materials with a surface area of only ca. 430 m2/g. Capacitance values have been enhanced either by additional oxygenated functionalisation of nanotubes (130 F/g) or by conducting polypyrrole (PPy) electrodeposition where the maximum values reached 170 F/g. The next domain of energy storage in the carbon nanostructures is the accumulation of hydrogen by the electrochemical decomposition of aqueous alkaline medium on a negatively polarized carbon electrode in ambient conditions. For SWNTs only moderate values (below 0.5 wt.{\%} of H2) have been found, while for activated carbons with highly developed surface area of 1500 m2/g, the amount of reversibly sorbed hydrogen was ca. 2 wt.{\%}, noticeably larger than under dihydrogen pressure (only 0.4 wt.{\%} for the same material at 70 bar and 273 K). The enhancement observed for the activated carbon is interpreted by the formation of nascent hydrogen during water reduction which penetrates easily in the available carbon nanopores. The values obtained by this method are comparable to those of metallic alloys, such as LaNi5 for example. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The recent development of the lithium ion secondary batteries has been achieved by the use of selected carbon and graphite materials as an anode. The performance of lithium ion secondary batteries, such as the charge/discharge capacity, voltage profile and cyclic stability, depend strongly on the microstructure of the anode materials made of carbon and graphite. Due to the contribution of the carbon materials used in the anode in last five years, the capacity of the typical Li ion battery has been improved 1.7 times. However, there are still active investigations to identify the key parameters of carbons that provide the improved anode properties, as carbon and graphite materials have large varieties in the microstructure, texture, crystallinity and morphology, depending on their preparation processes and precursor materials, as well as various forms such as powder, fibers and spherule. In the present article, we describe the correlation between the microstructural parameters and electrochemical properties of conventional and novel types of carbon materials for Li ion batteries, namely, graphitizable carbons such as milled mesophase pitch-based carbon fibers, polyparaphenylene-based carbon heat-treated at low temperatures and boron-doped graphitized materials, by connecting with the market demand and the trends in Li ion secondary batteries. The basic scientific theory can contribute to further developments of the Li ion batteries such as polymer batteries for consumer electronics, multimedia technology and future hybrid and electric vehicles.},

abstract = {Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) of high graphitization degree were prepared by a CVD process at 550-700 °C. They showed different structures according to catalyst and preparation temperatures. The structure of CNF prepared from CO/H2 over an iron catalyst was controlled from platelet (P) to tubular (T) by raising the decomposition temperature from 550 to 700 °C. The CNFs prepared over a copper-nickel catalyst from C2H 4/H2 showed the typical herringbone (HB) structure regardless of the reaction temperatures. The CNFs prepared over Fe showed d 002 of 0.3363-0.3381 nm, similar to that of graphite, indicating very high graphitization degree in spite of the low preparation temperature. Such CNFs of high graphitization degree showed high capacity of 297-431 mA h/g, especially in the low potential region. However, low first cycle coulombic efficiency of ≈60{\%} is a problem to be solved. The graphitization of the CNF preserved the platelet texture, however, and formed the loops to connect the edges of the graphene sheets. Higher graphitization temperatures made the loop more definite. The graphitized CNF showed high capacity (367 mA h/g); however, its coulombic efficiency was not so large despite its modified edges by graphitization, indicating that the graphene edges were not so influential for the irreversible reaction of Li ion battery. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Supercapacitors (also known as 'ultracapacitors') offer a promising alternative approach to meeting the increasing power demands of energy-storage systems in general, and of portable (digital) electronic devices in particular. Supercapacitors are able to store and deliver energy at relatively high rates (beyond those accessible with batteries) because the mechanism of energy storage is simple charge-separation (as in conventional capacitors). The vast increases in capacitance achieved by supercapacitors are due to the combination of: (i) an extremely small distance that separates the opposite charges, as defined by the electric double-layer; (ii) highly porous electrodes that embody very high surface-area. A variety of porous forms of carbon are currently preferred as the electrode materials because they have exceptionally high surface areas, relatively high electronic conductivity, and acceptable cost. The power and energy-storage capabilities of these devices are closely linked to the physical and chemical characteristics of the carbon electrodes. For example, increases in specific surface-area, obtained through activation of the carbon, generally lead to increased capacitance. Since only the electrolyte-wetted surface-area contributes to capacitance, the carbon processing is required to generate predominantly 'open' pores that are connected to the bulk pore network. While the supercapacitors available today perform well, it is generally agreed that there is considerable scope for improvement (e.g., improved performance at higher frequencies). Thus it is likely that carbon will continue to play a principal role in supercapacitor technology, mainly through further optimization of porosity, surface treatments to promote wettability, and reduced inter-particle contact resistance. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

In keeping with the observed behavioural response to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin there were marked increases in cerebellum (+ 56{\%}) and motor cortex where a columnar arrangement of increased metabolism (+ 34{\%}) contrasted with adjacent columns of decrease (- 26{\%}). Hippocampal areas showed moderate decreases in glucose use (-13 to -21{\%}). All areas which increased following 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin also increased following 5-methoxy 3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)1H indole, succinate, but in the latter case all elements of the basal ganglia were also increased, including globus pallidus (+ 105{\%}) and the striatum where the changes (+ 54{\%}) were limited to a discrete dorsal region of the nucleus. In the hippocampus only dorsal dentate gyrus was decreased (- 24{\%}) whilst a moderate increase (+16{\%}) was observed in dorsal subiculum. The complexity of these results contrasts with previous 2-deoxyglucose investigations where less specific 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor ligands were used,11,30 and suggests that certain aspects of brain function may be selectively targeted by systemic pharmacological manipulation of endogenous serotonergic systems. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {The influence of support surface chemistry and metal precursor species on the properties of Pt/C catalysts has been analyzed. The char of a phenolformaldehyde polymer is the carbon source for obtaining four different supports: three with different degree of surface oxidation and another one modified by ion-exchanged calcium. These supports have been impregnated with aqueous solutions of two platinum precursors with different ionic character: chloroplatinic acid and tetraaminplatinum chloride. The study of the system consists of a preliminary characterization of the supports (surface chemistry and textural properties), an EXAFS analysis of the fresh impregnated catalysts and the determination of platinum dispersion. The platinum precursor-support interaction, established after the impregnation step, and the platinum precursor distribution have been related to the surface chemistry of the supports and the platinum precursor used. The effect of these parameters in the final metal dispersion has also been investigated. The results obtained show that the degree of support surface oxidation has a strong influence on the distribution of the metal precursor on the support and, consequently, on the final platinum dispersion. The surface oxidation of the supports seems to have a negative effect on the platinum dispersion, independently of the platinum precursor used. Thus, the lower the number of surface oxygen complexes, the higher the metal dispersion. The reduction of precursor H2PtCl6 by interaction with the carbon has also been found to depend on the surface chemistry of the supports. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Background: Cell transplantation for the regeneration of ischemic myocardium is limited by poor graft viability and low cell retention. In ischemic cardiomyopathy, the extracellular matrix is deeply altered; therefore, it could be important to associate a procedure aiming at regenerating myocardial cells and restoring the extracellular matrix function. We evaluated the feasibility and safety of intrainfarct cell therapy associated with a cell-seeded collagen scaffold grafted onto infarcted ventricles. Methods: In 20 consecutive patients presenting with left ventricular postischemic myocardial scars and indication for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, bone marrow cells were implanted during surgery. In the last 10 patients, we added a collagen matrix seeded with bone marrow cells, placed onto the scar. Results: There was no mortality and any related adverse events (follow-up 10 ± 3.5 months). New York Heart Association functional class improved in both groups from 2.3 ± 0.5 to 1.3 ± 0.5 (matrix, p = 0.0002) versus 2.4 ± 0.5 to 1.5 ± 0.5 (no matrix, p = 0.001). Left ventricular end-diastolic volume evolved from 142.4 ± 24.5 mL to 112.9 ± 27.3 mL (matrix, p = 0.02) versus 138.9 ± 36.1 mL to 148.7 ± 41 mL (no matrix, p = 0.57), left ventricular filling deceleration time improved significantly in the matrix group from 162 ± 7 ms to 198 ± 9 ms (p = 0.01) versus the no-matrix group (from 159 ± 5 ms to 167 ± 8 ms, p = 0.07). Scar area thickness progressed from 6 ± 1.4 to 9 mm ± 1.1 mm (matrix, p = 0.005) versus 5 ± 1.5 mm to 6 ± 0.8 mm (no matrix, p = 0.09). Ejection fraction improved in both groups, from 25.3{\%} ± 7.3{\%} to 32{\%} ± 5.4{\%} (matrix, p = 0.03) versus 27.2{\%} ± 6.9{\%} to 34.6{\%} ± 7.3{\%} (no matrix, p = 0.031). Conclusions: This tissue-engineered approach is feasible and safe and appears to improve the efficiency of cellular cardiomyoplasty. The cell-seeded collagen matrix increases the thickness of the infarct scar with viable tissue and helps to normalize cardiac wall stress in injured regions, thus limiting ventricular remodeling and improving diastolic function. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

abstract = {Background: Patients with end-stage bladder disease can be treated with cystoplasty using gastrointestinal segments. The presence of such segments in the urinary tract has been associated with many complications. We explored an alternative approach using autologous engineered bladder tissues for reconstruction. Methods: Seven patients with myelomeningocele, aged 4-19 years, with high-pressure or poorly compliant bladders, were identified as candidates for cystoplasty. A bladder biopsy was obtained from each patient. Urothelial and muscle cells were grown in culture, and seeded on a biodegradable bladder-shaped scaffold made of collagen, or a composite of collagen and polyglycolic acid. About 7 weeks after the biopsy, the autologous engineered bladder constructs were used for reconstruction and implanted either with or without an omental wrap. Serial urodynamics, cystograms, ultrasounds, bladder biopsies, and serum analyses were done. Results: Follow-up range was 22-61 months (mean 46 months). Post-operatively, the mean bladder leak point pressure decrease at capacity, and the volume and compliance increase was greatest in the composite engineered bladders with an omental wrap (56{\%}, 1{\textperiodcentered}58-fold, and 2{\textperiodcentered}79-fold, respectively). Bowel function returned promptly after surgery. No metabolic consequences were noted, urinary calculi did not form, mucus production was normal, and renal function was preserved. The engineered bladder biopsies showed an adequate structural architecture and phenotype. Conclusions: Engineered bladder tissues, created with autologous cells seeded on collagen-polyglycolic acid scaffolds, and wrapped in omentum after implantation, can be used in patients who need cystoplasty. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

One involves cell-free materials and/or factors and one involves delivering cells to contribute to the regeneration process. Of the many scaffold materials being investigated, collagen type I, with selective removal of its telopeptides, has been shown to have many advantageous features for both of these approaches. Highly porous collagen lattice sponges have been used to support in vitro growth of many types of tissues. Use of bioreactors to control in vitro perfusion of medium and to apply hydrostatic fluid pressure has been shown to enhance histogenesis in collagen scaffolds. Collagen sponges have also been developed to contain differentiating-inducing materials like demineralized bone to stimulate differentiation of cartilage tissue both in vitro and in vivo. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {It is well established that the process of neovascularization or neoangiogenesis is coupled to the development and maturation of bone. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) comprise a heterogeneous population of cells that can be differentiated in vitro into both mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal cell lineages. When both rat BMSCs and quail proepicardia (PEs) were seeded onto a three-dimensional (3-D) tubular scaffold engineered from aligned collagen type I strands and co-cultured in osteogenic media, the maturation and co-differentiation into osteoblastic and vascular cell lineages were observed. In addition, these cells produced abundant mineralized extracellular matrix materials and vessel-like structures. BMSCs were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/15 mm tube and cultured in basal media for 3 days. Subsequently, on day 3, PEs were seeded onto the same tubes and the co-culture was continued for another 3, 6 or 9 days either in basal or in osteogenic media. Differentiated cells were subjected to immunohistochemical, cytochemical and biochemical analyses. Phenotypic induction was analyzed at mRNA level by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Immunolocalization of key osteogenic and vasculogenic lineage specific markers were examined using confocal scanning laser microscopy. In osteogenic tube cultures, both early and late osteogenic markers were observed and were reminiscent of in vivo expression pattern. Alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium content significantly increased over the observed period of time in osteogenic medium. Abundant interlacing fascicles of QCPN, QH1, isolectin and $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin ($\alpha$-SMA) positive cells were observed in these tube cultures. These cells formed extensive arborizations of nascent capillary-like structures and were seen amidst the developing osteoblasts in osteogenic cultures. The 3-D culture system not only generated de novo vessel-like structures but also augmented the maturation and differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts. Thus, this novel co-culture system provides a useful in vitro model to investigate the functional role and effects of neovascularization in the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of BMSC derived osteoblasts. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Cells in a 3D bioscaffold for tissue engineering typically align new ECM components according to the bioscaffold provided. Therefore, scaffolds with a specific 3D structural design resembling the actual ECM of a particular tissue may have great potential in tissue engineering. Here, we show that, using specific freezing regimes, 3D scaffolds that mimic the 3D architecture of specific tissues can be made from collagen. Three examples are given, namely, scaffolds resembling the cup-shaped parenchymal (alveolar) architecture of lung, scaffolds that mimic the parallel collagen organization of tendon, and scaffolds that mimic the 3D organization of skin. For the preparation of these tissue-specific scaffolds, we relied on simple techniques without the need for expensive or customized equipment. Freezing rate, type of suspension medium, and additives (e.g., ethanol) were found to be prime parameters in controlling scaffold morphology. {\textcopyright} 2007 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

This implant is composed of filamentous uniaxially aligned carbon fibers coated with an absorbable polymer. This highly biocompatible implant acts as a scaffold for regrowth of collagenous tissue. The early strength of this repair is provided by the composite implant and by the rapid ingrowth and attachment of new tissue, which allows for an earlier and more vigorous rehabilitation program. Patients with a minimum follow-up of 1 year form the basis of this article. The overall average follow-up is 2.1 years. Three cohort groups were observed on a temporal basis and quantitatively evaluated at 1 year (N = 29), 18 months (N = 22), and 2 years (N = 20), respectively. These three groups demonstrated continuous improvement during the first postoperative year. A high level of function was maintained throughout the second year. Repair of chronic injuries (N = 15) was compared with repair of acute injuries (N = 12) at 1 year following surgery. Both groups greatly improved. However, the acute group had more serious preoperative deficits but improved to a slightly better overall level. Of the patients having at least 1 year follow-up, 86{\%} had a good or excellent result. There was no increased morbidity associated with the use of the carbon implant.},

abstract = {The introduction of two-photon polymerization (TPP) into the area of Carbon Micro Electromechanical Systems (C-MEMS) has enabled the fabrication of three-dimensional glassy carbon nanostructures with geometries previously unattainable through conventional UV lithography. Pyrolysis of TPP structures conveys a characteristic reduction of feature size—one that should be properly estimated in order to produce carbon microdevices with accuracy. In this work, we studied the volumetric shrinkage of TPP-derived microwires upon pyrolysis at 900 °C. Through this process, photoresist microwires thermally decompose and shrink by as much as 75{\%}, resulting in glassy carbon nanowires with linewidths between 300 and 550 nm. Even after the thermal decomposition induced by the pyrolysis step, the linewidth of the carbon nanowires was found to be dependent on the TPP exposure parameters. We have also found that the thermal stress induced during the pyrolysis step not only results in axial elongation of the nanowires, but also in buckling in the case of slender carbon nanowires (for aspect ratios greater than 30). Furthermore, we show that the calculated residual mass fraction that remains after pyrolysis depends on the characteristic dimensions of the photoresist microwires, a trend that is consistent with several works found in the literature. This phenomenon is explained through a semi-empirical model that estimates the feature size of the carbon structures, serving as a simple guideline for shrinkage evaluation in other designs.},

abstract = {Primarily is important to make awareness on the large quantities of agricultural/food waste that is lost every year, minute and second around the world. It estimates that each year, approximately one-third food produced for human consumption in the world is lost or wasted. The global volume of food wastage is estimated to be 1.6 Gtonnes of “primary product equivalents”, while the total wastage for the edible part of food is 1.3 Gtonnes. This amount can be weighed against total agricultural production (for food and non-food uses), which is about 6 Gtonnes.1 Without accounting for GHG emissions from land use change, the carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated to 3.3 Gtonnes of CO2 equivalent: as such, food wastage ranks as the third top emitter after USA and China. Globally, the blue water footprint (i.e. the consumption of surface and groundwater resources) of food wastage is about 250km, which is equivalent to the annual water discharge of the Volga river, or three times the volume of Lake Geneva. With such situations, it seems clear that a reduction of food wastage at global, regional, and national scales would have a substantial positive effect on natural and societal resources. Food wastage reduction would not only avoid pressure on scarce natural resources but also decrease the need to raise food production by 60 percent to meet the 2050 population demand.1 Fortunately, different kinds of methods have been proposed for reuse agricultural waste instead of remain in the environment. These residues occurred by processing, production and harvest of cereal products, fruits, vegetables and trees, and through stock farming. They are produced in large amounts worldwide and either burnt in the field or used as animal feed.2 Agricultural residues are lignocellulosic materials.3 Therefore, these wastes are used on production of industrial products such as organic acids, biofuels, protein enriched feed, aroma compounds, bioactive secondary metabolites, microbial pigments, mushroom and enzymes as substrate.4},
