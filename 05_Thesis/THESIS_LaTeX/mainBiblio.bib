abstract = {Over the last couple of decades, Carbon Nanowires (CNWs) have found important applications in the field of rapid label-free biosensing platforms for their excellent electrical, thermal and chemical properties. Despite the growing interest in incorporating these materials into sensitive analytical devices, there has been limited research efforts that explore the realistic incorporation of these structures into broader microsystems. The present dissertation explores two Advanced Additive Manufacturing (AdAM) techniques for the fabrication of CNWs with promising characteristics for sensing applications. The first technique, Electro-Mechanical Spinning (EMS) is a relatively new method for the production of CNWs with highly-oriented patterning capabilities, and is assessed in terms of the minimum feature sizes that it can attain reproducibly. The second method, Multiple Photon Polymerization (MPP) is a mature laser manufacturing technique that offers high repeatability, yet it has remained largely unexplored in the field of carbon materials. This work presents a study of how MPP can be used to create CNWs in terms of micro-fabrication parameters like laser power and scanning velocity. A thorough review study of the surface properties required for carbon materials to become eligible candidates in biosensing is also included in this dissertation. Lastly, an application of CNWs is presented, in which a Joule Heating technique is used to induce controlled breaking of the wires to produce nano-scale separated carbon electrodes, which hold potential for micro/nano particle manipulation in microfluidics.},

Direct-writing describes a broad family of fabrication methods that typically employ computer-controlled translational stages to manufacture structures at multi-length scales. This review focuses on light-assisted direct-write fabrication for generating 3D functional scaffolds with precise micro- and nano-architecture, using both synthetic as well as naturally derived biomaterials. Two bioprinting approaches are discussed in detail - projection printing and laser-based systems - where each method is capable of modulating multiple scaffold parameters, such as 3D architecture, mechanical properties (e.g. stiffness), Poisson's ratio, chemical gradients, biological cell distributions, and porosity. The light-assisted direct-writing techniques described in this review provide the reader with alternative approaches to fabricate 3D biomaterials for utility in LOCs.},

abstract = {In electrospinning process, polymer nanofibers are formed with diameters in the submicron scale when a drop of viscoelastic polymer solution is subjected to a high voltage electrostatic field, when the charge force overcomes the surface tension of the solution, a beam is projected onto a collector. Among other parameters, the rheological properties of the polymer solution can significantly influence fiber formation during the electrospinning process, although this is well known, there is still no clear understanding of the effect of these properties to form fibers with morphology and structure consistent and controlled. The study was conducted for a system of SU-8 2002 (an epoxy-based negative photoresist) dissolved in cyclopentanone with poly(ethylene) oxide, PEO, and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate, TBATFB, as additives. The fibers were electrospun in an Electro Mechanical Spinning, EMS, platform. The rheological properties of the polymer solution were studied under shear conditions and combined with oscillatory data to get uniaxial deformation behavior using the Wagner constitutive equation. The elongational viscosity in the projected beam is estimated by using data from oscillatory tests. For this purpose, solutions of SU-8 2002 were tested and then electrospun systematically over a range of concentrations. It was found that the variation in concentration of the additives modifies the viscoelastic properties of the solutions and, therefore, the electrospinnability. As PEO concentration is increased the complex, elongational and shear viscosity also increases. For concentrations of TBATFB, the variation of the viscosities has not a clear behavior pattern. The most regular and thinnest fibers were those obtained from a concentration of 99.5, 0.25 and 0.25 wt percent. of SU-8 2002, PEO and TBATFB respectively. With the acquired information, process variables for the EMS such as fabrication velocity, voltage and tip-to-collector distance were improved.},

abstract = {We discuss various scattering mechanisms for Dirac fermions in single-layer graphene. It is shown that scattering on a short-range potential (e.g. due to neutral impurities) is mostly irrelevant for electronic quality of graphene, which is likely to be controlled by charged impurities and ripples (microscopic corrugations of a graphene sheet). The latter are an inherent feature of graphene due to its two-dimensional nature and can also be an important factor in defining the electron mean-free path. We show that certain types of ripples create a long-range scattering potential, similar to Coulomb scatterers, and result in charge-carrier mobility practically independent of carrier concentration, in agreement with experimental observations. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

These are not the familiar clashes between liberals and conservatives or the religious and the secular: instead, they are clashes between a new moral culture-victimhood culture-and a more traditional culture of dignity. Even as students increasingly demand trigger warnings and “safe spaces,” many young people are quick to police the words and deeds of others, who in turn claim that political correctness has run amok. Interestingly, members of both camps often consider themselves victims of the other. In tracking the rise of victimhood culture, Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning help to decode an often dizzying cultural milieu, from campus riots over conservative speakers and debates around free speech to the election of Donald Trump.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes with different structures were catalytically synthesized on Ni coated SiO 2/Si substrate in a Direct Current Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition system, in which C 2H 2 acted as the carbon source and NH 3 as the etchant gas. A Scanning Electron Microscope study showed that carbon nanotubes were all vertically aligned with respect to the substrate, with diameters ranging from 10 nm to 200 nm. Different sizes of Ni catalyst particles were observed on the tips of carbon nanotubes. Transmission Electron Microscopy was used to study the morphology of the grown tubes and the results obtained show that the diameters and structures of these carbon nanotubes were closely correlated to the sizes and structures of the Ni nanoparticies. Two main structures namely bamboo shaped carbon nanotubes and herringbone shaped carbon nanofibres were found on the same sample. It is suggested that by controlling the pre-growth condition, desired structure of carbon nanotubes or carbon nanofibres could be produced for practical applications.

The simplicity and scalability of this process, as well as the hierarchical organization of CNWs, provides a potential alternative to the use of carbon nanotubes and graphene for applications in microsystems and high surface area materials. The CNWs are highly branched at the nanoscale, and novel hierarchical microstructures with CNWs connected to a solid amorphous core are made by controlling the plasma treatment time. By multilayer processing we demonstrate deterministic joining of CNW micropillars into 3D sensing networks. Finally we show that these networks can be chemically functionalized and used for measurement of DNA binding with increased sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Sensitivity, detection range and response time of sensors have been remarkably ameliorated by using nanotechnological methods. Faster, better, cheaper and smaller sensors are becoming available. Sensor development in the nanotechnology age, the focal theme of this book, is one of the hottest topics in contemporary research. The book presents a critical appraisal of the new opportunities provided by nanotechnologies, and the nanotechnology-enabled advancements in the field of sensors. Being a new topic, information on nanosensors is scattered in research journals and reports. There is a paucity of books in this area. This book is intended to fill this long-felt need.

Only a limited range of coal rank i.e. the bituminous coals, produce acceptable metallurgical cokes. The history of coke making is briefly reviewed followed by description of a coke battery and the by-products of coking. Theories of carbonization are abundant but current knowledge of liquid crystal theory has done much to expand the understanding of the origin of cokes and their properties. Coal Rank, Type and Grade are properties used in coal classification for coke making. The coking of a single coal particle and the development of the coke cenosphere are described. The importance of the plastic (fluid) layer, developed within the coal charge in the slot coke oven, is high-lighted including the thermal transformation of coal macerals to coke components. In industrial practice, the ability to predict coke strength or mechanical stability from properties of coal blends is of obvious importance. Much has been done to analyse coke structure in terms of optical microscopy of polished sections, i.e. coke petrography. This exhibits the various isotropic and anisotropic components of coke structure. Cokes from different coal blends have different contents of anisotropic shapes, 0.5 to {\textgreater}25.0 $\mu$m in size, arising from the heterogeneous nature of the plastic (fluid) phase of carbonization from which the liquid crystal structures develop. Classifications of anisotropy are listed. The Chapter continues with descriptions of porosity and pore wall structures in cokes. Carbonization variables relate to final coke property. The behaviour of coke in the blast furnace, including discussions of reactivity, aspects of formed coke, pre-heating and co-carbonization conclude the Chapter.},

We fabricate graphene @ gold nanorods (G@GNRs) nanocomposites by successively using dropping and transferring methods Through SEM, Raman spectra and TEM analysis, the number of graphene layers is 6–7. The diameter of gold nanorods (GNRs) is about 10 nm and the average aspect ratio is 6.5. In addition, we systematically investigate their nonlinear optical responses by using open-aperture Z-scan technique. In contrast with graphene and GNRs, the G@GNRs nanocomposites exhibit excellent nonlinear optical response with a modulation depth of about 51{\%} and a saturable intensity of about 6.23 GW/cm 2 . The results suggest that the G@GNRs nanocomposites could potentially be used as an optical modulator in pulsed laser generation.},

abstract = {Planar microsupercapacitors are emerging as essential devices for rapid energy sourcing in on-chip circuitry. A serious limitation in comparison to planar microbatteries is the energy density that a planar supercapacitor can offer (∼two orders less), which in turn relates to the maximum working potential of the electrolyte used in it, which is typically below 3 V. In this article, we report the fabrication of a planar supercapacitor with an operating voltage window, highest among the reported till date. The electrolyte used is essentially a solid in the form of nanofibres of a supramolecular donor-acceptor assembly, consisting of coronene tetracarboxylate salt (CS) and dodecyl methyl viologen (DMV), carrying positive (K+) and negative (Br−) ionic charges, respectively. The fibres are drop-spread across Ti microgap electrodes and the device is operated in the ambient or in a humidity-controlled cell. The device is found stable up to a working potential window of 8 V, exhibiting areal capacitance values of 0.2 mF/cm2 under room humidity conditions (RH, 65{\%}) which was enhanced to 9.5 mF/cm2 under 90{\%} RH in presence of hygroscopic KBr crystallites. The estimated areal energy and power density values are remarkable, 85 $\mu$Wh cm−2 and 24.7 W cm−2 respectively. The device retained 86{\%} capacitance even after 50000 charge-discharge cycles. Using a single device, AC line filtering is shown possible with ripple less than 5{\%}. These extraordinary properties are borne out of the facile diffusion of ions along the 1D face-to-face arrangement of the D-A molecules in the nanofibres while the ambient oxide covered Ti surface providing the required electrochemical stability to the device.},

abstract = {Nanomaterials inevitably have bright prospects, but even now they play an important role in many areas of industry. Some of these new materials are commercially available and are used in off the shelf products, others are important model systems for physicochemical and materials science research. However, research findings and application data are not compiled in a single work. The Springer Handbook of Nanomaterials collects description and data of materials which have dimensions on the nanoscale. The description of nanomaterials follows the interplay of structure, properties, processing and applications mainly in their solid phase. The chapters were arranged according to the classical materials-science classifications: carbon materials, metals, ceramics, composites, and biomaterials. For each part, materials structures represent different dimensionality; zero-dimensional clusters, nanoparticles and quantum dots, one-dimensional nanowires and nanotubes, and two-dimensional thin films and surfaces. Combinations cover for instance nanostructured and hybrid materials. Almost 100 leading scientists from academia and the industry were selected to write the 32 chapters and collect the physical, chemical and mechanical data. The handbook was written and compiled for professionals and practitioners, materials scientists, physicists and chemists at universities, as well as in the fields of industrial research and production. The Handbook is organized in seven parts. Part A: NanoCarbons. Part B: NanoMetals. Part C: NanoCeramics. Part D: NanoComposits. Part E: Nanoporous Materials. Part F: Organic and Biomaterilas.

abstract = {The discovery of fullerenes (also known as buckyballs) has generated tremendous excitement and opened up a new field of carbon chemistry. As the first book available on this topic, this volume will be a landmark reference in the field. Because buckyballs are essentially closed hollow cages made up of carbon atoms, they can be manipulated in a variety of ways to yield never-before-seen materials. The balls can, for instance, be doped with atoms or pulled out into tubules and filled with lead to provide properties of high-temperature superconductivity. Researchers can now create their own buckyballs in a process that is almost as simple as making soot, making this research as inexpensive as it is exotic (which has doubtless contributed to its popularity). Researchers anticipate that fullerenes will offer boundless opportunities in the development of new products, drugs and materials.

The structural change of CNFs through KOH activation was investigated by using SEM, TEM and XRD. KOH activation was found to be effective to develop particular pore sizes on the CNF surface, increasing the surface area of CNF. The increase of surface area in KOH activation of CNF is first ascribed to local broadening of graphene interstices or local burn-off of graphenes, which limit the surface area increase of CNF with the fiber structure maintained. The activation under severe conditions caused to destroy the fiber structure of CNF. Activated CNFs were applied as an electrode for electrical double layer capacitors to be compared to active carbon fibers in terms of the surface properties. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Prepared CSCNT-dispersed CFRP laminates are subject to Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) and End Notched Flexure (ENF) tests in order to obtain mode-I and mode-II interlaminar fracture toughness. The measured fracture toughnesses are compared to that of CFRP laminates without CSCNT to evaluate the effectiveness of CSCNT dispersion for the improvement of fracture toughness. All CSCNT-dispersed CFRP laminates exhibit higher fracture toughness, and specifically, CSCNT-dispersed CFRP laminates with thin epoxy interlayers containing short CSCNTs have three times higher fracture toughness than CFRP laminates without CSCNT. SEM observation of fracture surfaces is also conducted to investigate the mechanisms of fracture toughness improvement.

abstract = {Ultrafine fibers of polyaniline doped with camphorsulfonic acid (PAn.HCSA) blended with polyethylene oxide (PEO) were prepared by a non-mechanical, electrostatic spinning (`electrospinning') technique. The morphology and fiber diameter of electrospun polyaniline blend fibers revealed that both the PEO and the PAn.HCSA/PEO blend fibers had a diameter ranging between 950 nm and 2.1 $\mu$m, with a generally uniform thickness along the fiber. The UV-visible spectra of these electrospun fibers were similar to those for cast films produced from the same solutions. As expected, the conductivity of the non-woven fiber mat, as measured by the four-point probe method, was slightly lower than that of a cast film, due to the high porosity of the non-woven mat. The rate for the vapor phase de-doping/re-doping of the electrospun fibers is at least one order of magnitude faster than for cast films, stressing the enormous effect an increase in the surface-to-volume ratio, accomplished by electrospinning the material into fibers, can have on the selected chemical properties of polyaniline blends.},

abstract = {A variety of techniques for the manufacture of biodegradable, three-dimensional scaffolds for tissue engineering have been developed in recent years. In this study, we report and compare two simple methods for fabricating poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds with feature sizes of 10-200 $\mu$m, which have been developed in our laboratories. The first technique is based on the use of a microsyringe that makes use of a computer-controlled, three-axis micropositioner, which allows the control of motor speeds and position. A PLGA solution is drawn from the needle of the syringe by the application of a constant pressure of 10-300 mm Hg resulting in controlled polymer deposition of 10-600 $\mu$m in diameter. The second technique is based on "soft lithographic" approaches that utilizes a Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) mold. The polymer solution is cast on the mold under vacuum. Polymer concentration, solvent composition, and casting conditions influence the integrity and the lateral resolution of the resulting scaffold. Both techniques allow the possibility of constructing three-dimensional architectures that permit the study of cell behaviour in an environment similar to that in vivo, and may provide tools for the construction of engineered tissue. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Possibilities of electrochemical energy conversion using carbon nanotubes and related materials in various systems, such as lithium batteries, supercapacitors, hydrogen storage, are considered. It is shown that for these applications the electrochemical properties of multiwalled (MWNTs) and single walled (SWNTs) nanotubes are essentially dominated by their mesoporous character. During lithium insertion into nanotubular materials a high irreversible capacity Cirr (from 460 to 1080 mAh/g) has been observed after the first cycle with a tendency to further decomposition of electrolyte with cycling. Penetration of solvated lithium ions in the accessible mesopores is at the origin of this phenomenon; an almost linear dependence has been found between the mesopore volume and Cirr. Reversible capacity for lithium insertion Crev ranged between 220 and 780 mAh/g; however, a great divergence (hysteresis) between insertion and extraction characteristics was observed independently on the kind of nanotubes and oxygen content. Amount of lithium stored by electrostatic attraction is negligible in comparison to real redox reactions which for thermodynamic reasons present linear variation of potential, especially during deinsertion (pseudocapacitive effects). During positive polarization, i.e., removal of lithium, resistivity of the electrode also gradually increases. Due to the open network of mesopores formed by the nanotubes entanglement, and consequently an easily accessible electrode-electrolyte interface, nanotubular materials are quite adapted for supercapacitor electrodes in various electrolytic solutions. High values of capacitance (80 F/g) have been obtained in 6 M KOH for materials with a surface area of only ca. 430 m2/g. Capacitance values have been enhanced either by additional oxygenated functionalisation of nanotubes (130 F/g) or by conducting polypyrrole (PPy) electrodeposition where the maximum values reached 170 F/g. The next domain of energy storage in the carbon nanostructures is the accumulation of hydrogen by the electrochemical decomposition of aqueous alkaline medium on a negatively polarized carbon electrode in ambient conditions. For SWNTs only moderate values (below 0.5 wt.{\%} of H2) have been found, while for activated carbons with highly developed surface area of 1500 m2/g, the amount of reversibly sorbed hydrogen was ca. 2 wt.{\%}, noticeably larger than under dihydrogen pressure (only 0.4 wt.{\%} for the same material at 70 bar and 273 K). The enhancement observed for the activated carbon is interpreted by the formation of nascent hydrogen during water reduction which penetrates easily in the available carbon nanopores. The values obtained by this method are comparable to those of metallic alloys, such as LaNi5 for example. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The recent development of the lithium ion secondary batteries has been achieved by the use of selected carbon and graphite materials as an anode. The performance of lithium ion secondary batteries, such as the charge/discharge capacity, voltage profile and cyclic stability, depend strongly on the microstructure of the anode materials made of carbon and graphite. Due to the contribution of the carbon materials used in the anode in last five years, the capacity of the typical Li ion battery has been improved 1.7 times. However, there are still active investigations to identify the key parameters of carbons that provide the improved anode properties, as carbon and graphite materials have large varieties in the microstructure, texture, crystallinity and morphology, depending on their preparation processes and precursor materials, as well as various forms such as powder, fibers and spherule. In the present article, we describe the correlation between the microstructural parameters and electrochemical properties of conventional and novel types of carbon materials for Li ion batteries, namely, graphitizable carbons such as milled mesophase pitch-based carbon fibers, polyparaphenylene-based carbon heat-treated at low temperatures and boron-doped graphitized materials, by connecting with the market demand and the trends in Li ion secondary batteries. The basic scientific theory can contribute to further developments of the Li ion batteries such as polymer batteries for consumer electronics, multimedia technology and future hybrid and electric vehicles.},

abstract = {Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) of high graphitization degree were prepared by a CVD process at 550-700 °C. They showed different structures according to catalyst and preparation temperatures. The structure of CNF prepared from CO/H2 over an iron catalyst was controlled from platelet (P) to tubular (T) by raising the decomposition temperature from 550 to 700 °C. The CNFs prepared over a copper-nickel catalyst from C2H 4/H2 showed the typical herringbone (HB) structure regardless of the reaction temperatures. The CNFs prepared over Fe showed d 002 of 0.3363-0.3381 nm, similar to that of graphite, indicating very high graphitization degree in spite of the low preparation temperature. Such CNFs of high graphitization degree showed high capacity of 297-431 mA h/g, especially in the low potential region. However, low first cycle coulombic efficiency of ≈60{\%} is a problem to be solved. The graphitization of the CNF preserved the platelet texture, however, and formed the loops to connect the edges of the graphene sheets. Higher graphitization temperatures made the loop more definite. The graphitized CNF showed high capacity (367 mA h/g); however, its coulombic efficiency was not so large despite its modified edges by graphitization, indicating that the graphene edges were not so influential for the irreversible reaction of Li ion battery. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Supercapacitors (also known as 'ultracapacitors') offer a promising alternative approach to meeting the increasing power demands of energy-storage systems in general, and of portable (digital) electronic devices in particular. Supercapacitors are able to store and deliver energy at relatively high rates (beyond those accessible with batteries) because the mechanism of energy storage is simple charge-separation (as in conventional capacitors). The vast increases in capacitance achieved by supercapacitors are due to the combination of: (i) an extremely small distance that separates the opposite charges, as defined by the electric double-layer; (ii) highly porous electrodes that embody very high surface-area. A variety of porous forms of carbon are currently preferred as the electrode materials because they have exceptionally high surface areas, relatively high electronic conductivity, and acceptable cost. The power and energy-storage capabilities of these devices are closely linked to the physical and chemical characteristics of the carbon electrodes. For example, increases in specific surface-area, obtained through activation of the carbon, generally lead to increased capacitance. Since only the electrolyte-wetted surface-area contributes to capacitance, the carbon processing is required to generate predominantly 'open' pores that are connected to the bulk pore network. While the supercapacitors available today perform well, it is generally agreed that there is considerable scope for improvement (e.g., improved performance at higher frequencies). Thus it is likely that carbon will continue to play a principal role in supercapacitor technology, mainly through further optimization of porosity, surface treatments to promote wettability, and reduced inter-particle contact resistance. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

In keeping with the observed behavioural response to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin there were marked increases in cerebellum (+ 56{\%}) and motor cortex where a columnar arrangement of increased metabolism (+ 34{\%}) contrasted with adjacent columns of decrease (- 26{\%}). Hippocampal areas showed moderate decreases in glucose use (-13 to -21{\%}). All areas which increased following 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin also increased following 5-methoxy 3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)1H indole, succinate, but in the latter case all elements of the basal ganglia were also increased, including globus pallidus (+ 105{\%}) and the striatum where the changes (+ 54{\%}) were limited to a discrete dorsal region of the nucleus. In the hippocampus only dorsal dentate gyrus was decreased (- 24{\%}) whilst a moderate increase (+16{\%}) was observed in dorsal subiculum. The complexity of these results contrasts with previous 2-deoxyglucose investigations where less specific 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor ligands were used,11,30 and suggests that certain aspects of brain function may be selectively targeted by systemic pharmacological manipulation of endogenous serotonergic systems. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {The influence of support surface chemistry and metal precursor species on the properties of Pt/C catalysts has been analyzed. The char of a phenolformaldehyde polymer is the carbon source for obtaining four different supports: three with different degree of surface oxidation and another one modified by ion-exchanged calcium. These supports have been impregnated with aqueous solutions of two platinum precursors with different ionic character: chloroplatinic acid and tetraaminplatinum chloride. The study of the system consists of a preliminary characterization of the supports (surface chemistry and textural properties), an EXAFS analysis of the fresh impregnated catalysts and the determination of platinum dispersion. The platinum precursor-support interaction, established after the impregnation step, and the platinum precursor distribution have been related to the surface chemistry of the supports and the platinum precursor used. The effect of these parameters in the final metal dispersion has also been investigated. The results obtained show that the degree of support surface oxidation has a strong influence on the distribution of the metal precursor on the support and, consequently, on the final platinum dispersion. The surface oxidation of the supports seems to have a negative effect on the platinum dispersion, independently of the platinum precursor used. Thus, the lower the number of surface oxygen complexes, the higher the metal dispersion. The reduction of precursor H2PtCl6 by interaction with the carbon has also been found to depend on the surface chemistry of the supports. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Background: Cell transplantation for the regeneration of ischemic myocardium is limited by poor graft viability and low cell retention. In ischemic cardiomyopathy, the extracellular matrix is deeply altered; therefore, it could be important to associate a procedure aiming at regenerating myocardial cells and restoring the extracellular matrix function. We evaluated the feasibility and safety of intrainfarct cell therapy associated with a cell-seeded collagen scaffold grafted onto infarcted ventricles. Methods: In 20 consecutive patients presenting with left ventricular postischemic myocardial scars and indication for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, bone marrow cells were implanted during surgery. In the last 10 patients, we added a collagen matrix seeded with bone marrow cells, placed onto the scar. Results: There was no mortality and any related adverse events (follow-up 10 ± 3.5 months). New York Heart Association functional class improved in both groups from 2.3 ± 0.5 to 1.3 ± 0.5 (matrix, p = 0.0002) versus 2.4 ± 0.5 to 1.5 ± 0.5 (no matrix, p = 0.001). Left ventricular end-diastolic volume evolved from 142.4 ± 24.5 mL to 112.9 ± 27.3 mL (matrix, p = 0.02) versus 138.9 ± 36.1 mL to 148.7 ± 41 mL (no matrix, p = 0.57), left ventricular filling deceleration time improved significantly in the matrix group from 162 ± 7 ms to 198 ± 9 ms (p = 0.01) versus the no-matrix group (from 159 ± 5 ms to 167 ± 8 ms, p = 0.07). Scar area thickness progressed from 6 ± 1.4 to 9 mm ± 1.1 mm (matrix, p = 0.005) versus 5 ± 1.5 mm to 6 ± 0.8 mm (no matrix, p = 0.09). Ejection fraction improved in both groups, from 25.3{\%} ± 7.3{\%} to 32{\%} ± 5.4{\%} (matrix, p = 0.03) versus 27.2{\%} ± 6.9{\%} to 34.6{\%} ± 7.3{\%} (no matrix, p = 0.031). Conclusions: This tissue-engineered approach is feasible and safe and appears to improve the efficiency of cellular cardiomyoplasty. The cell-seeded collagen matrix increases the thickness of the infarct scar with viable tissue and helps to normalize cardiac wall stress in injured regions, thus limiting ventricular remodeling and improving diastolic function. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

abstract = {Background: Patients with end-stage bladder disease can be treated with cystoplasty using gastrointestinal segments. The presence of such segments in the urinary tract has been associated with many complications. We explored an alternative approach using autologous engineered bladder tissues for reconstruction. Methods: Seven patients with myelomeningocele, aged 4-19 years, with high-pressure or poorly compliant bladders, were identified as candidates for cystoplasty. A bladder biopsy was obtained from each patient. Urothelial and muscle cells were grown in culture, and seeded on a biodegradable bladder-shaped scaffold made of collagen, or a composite of collagen and polyglycolic acid. About 7 weeks after the biopsy, the autologous engineered bladder constructs were used for reconstruction and implanted either with or without an omental wrap. Serial urodynamics, cystograms, ultrasounds, bladder biopsies, and serum analyses were done. Results: Follow-up range was 22-61 months (mean 46 months). Post-operatively, the mean bladder leak point pressure decrease at capacity, and the volume and compliance increase was greatest in the composite engineered bladders with an omental wrap (56{\%}, 1{\textperiodcentered}58-fold, and 2{\textperiodcentered}79-fold, respectively). Bowel function returned promptly after surgery. No metabolic consequences were noted, urinary calculi did not form, mucus production was normal, and renal function was preserved. The engineered bladder biopsies showed an adequate structural architecture and phenotype. Conclusions: Engineered bladder tissues, created with autologous cells seeded on collagen-polyglycolic acid scaffolds, and wrapped in omentum after implantation, can be used in patients who need cystoplasty. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

One involves cell-free materials and/or factors and one involves delivering cells to contribute to the regeneration process. Of the many scaffold materials being investigated, collagen type I, with selective removal of its telopeptides, has been shown to have many advantageous features for both of these approaches. Highly porous collagen lattice sponges have been used to support in vitro growth of many types of tissues. Use of bioreactors to control in vitro perfusion of medium and to apply hydrostatic fluid pressure has been shown to enhance histogenesis in collagen scaffolds. Collagen sponges have also been developed to contain differentiating-inducing materials like demineralized bone to stimulate differentiation of cartilage tissue both in vitro and in vivo. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {It is well established that the process of neovascularization or neoangiogenesis is coupled to the development and maturation of bone. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) comprise a heterogeneous population of cells that can be differentiated in vitro into both mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal cell lineages. When both rat BMSCs and quail proepicardia (PEs) were seeded onto a three-dimensional (3-D) tubular scaffold engineered from aligned collagen type I strands and co-cultured in osteogenic media, the maturation and co-differentiation into osteoblastic and vascular cell lineages were observed. In addition, these cells produced abundant mineralized extracellular matrix materials and vessel-like structures. BMSCs were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/15 mm tube and cultured in basal media for 3 days. Subsequently, on day 3, PEs were seeded onto the same tubes and the co-culture was continued for another 3, 6 or 9 days either in basal or in osteogenic media. Differentiated cells were subjected to immunohistochemical, cytochemical and biochemical analyses. Phenotypic induction was analyzed at mRNA level by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Immunolocalization of key osteogenic and vasculogenic lineage specific markers were examined using confocal scanning laser microscopy. In osteogenic tube cultures, both early and late osteogenic markers were observed and were reminiscent of in vivo expression pattern. Alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium content significantly increased over the observed period of time in osteogenic medium. Abundant interlacing fascicles of QCPN, QH1, isolectin and $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin ($\alpha$-SMA) positive cells were observed in these tube cultures. These cells formed extensive arborizations of nascent capillary-like structures and were seen amidst the developing osteoblasts in osteogenic cultures. The 3-D culture system not only generated de novo vessel-like structures but also augmented the maturation and differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts. Thus, this novel co-culture system provides a useful in vitro model to investigate the functional role and effects of neovascularization in the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of BMSC derived osteoblasts. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Cells in a 3D bioscaffold for tissue engineering typically align new ECM components according to the bioscaffold provided. Therefore, scaffolds with a specific 3D structural design resembling the actual ECM of a particular tissue may have great potential in tissue engineering. Here, we show that, using specific freezing regimes, 3D scaffolds that mimic the 3D architecture of specific tissues can be made from collagen. Three examples are given, namely, scaffolds resembling the cup-shaped parenchymal (alveolar) architecture of lung, scaffolds that mimic the parallel collagen organization of tendon, and scaffolds that mimic the 3D organization of skin. For the preparation of these tissue-specific scaffolds, we relied on simple techniques without the need for expensive or customized equipment. Freezing rate, type of suspension medium, and additives (e.g., ethanol) were found to be prime parameters in controlling scaffold morphology. {\textcopyright} 2007 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

This implant is composed of filamentous uniaxially aligned carbon fibers coated with an absorbable polymer. This highly biocompatible implant acts as a scaffold for regrowth of collagenous tissue. The early strength of this repair is provided by the composite implant and by the rapid ingrowth and attachment of new tissue, which allows for an earlier and more vigorous rehabilitation program. Patients with a minimum follow-up of 1 year form the basis of this article. The overall average follow-up is 2.1 years. Three cohort groups were observed on a temporal basis and quantitatively evaluated at 1 year (N = 29), 18 months (N = 22), and 2 years (N = 20), respectively. These three groups demonstrated continuous improvement during the first postoperative year. A high level of function was maintained throughout the second year. Repair of chronic injuries (N = 15) was compared with repair of acute injuries (N = 12) at 1 year following surgery. Both groups greatly improved. However, the acute group had more serious preoperative deficits but improved to a slightly better overall level. Of the patients having at least 1 year follow-up, 86{\%} had a good or excellent result. There was no increased morbidity associated with the use of the carbon implant.},

abstract = {The introduction of two-photon polymerization (TPP) into the area of Carbon Micro Electromechanical Systems (C-MEMS) has enabled the fabrication of three-dimensional glassy carbon nanostructures with geometries previously unattainable through conventional UV lithography. Pyrolysis of TPP structures conveys a characteristic reduction of feature size—one that should be properly estimated in order to produce carbon microdevices with accuracy. In this work, we studied the volumetric shrinkage of TPP-derived microwires upon pyrolysis at 900 °C. Through this process, photoresist microwires thermally decompose and shrink by as much as 75{\%}, resulting in glassy carbon nanowires with linewidths between 300 and 550 nm. Even after the thermal decomposition induced by the pyrolysis step, the linewidth of the carbon nanowires was found to be dependent on the TPP exposure parameters. We have also found that the thermal stress induced during the pyrolysis step not only results in axial elongation of the nanowires, but also in buckling in the case of slender carbon nanowires (for aspect ratios greater than 30). Furthermore, we show that the calculated residual mass fraction that remains after pyrolysis depends on the characteristic dimensions of the photoresist microwires, a trend that is consistent with several works found in the literature. This phenomenon is explained through a semi-empirical model that estimates the feature size of the carbon structures, serving as a simple guideline for shrinkage evaluation in other designs.},

abstract = {Primarily is important to make awareness on the large quantities of agricultural/food waste that is lost every year, minute and second around the world. It estimates that each year, approximately one-third food produced for human consumption in the world is lost or wasted. The global volume of food wastage is estimated to be 1.6 Gtonnes of “primary product equivalents”, while the total wastage for the edible part of food is 1.3 Gtonnes. This amount can be weighed against total agricultural production (for food and non-food uses), which is about 6 Gtonnes.1 Without accounting for GHG emissions from land use change, the carbon footprint of food produced and not eaten is estimated to 3.3 Gtonnes of CO2 equivalent: as such, food wastage ranks as the third top emitter after USA and China. Globally, the blue water footprint (i.e. the consumption of surface and groundwater resources) of food wastage is about 250km, which is equivalent to the annual water discharge of the Volga river, or three times the volume of Lake Geneva. With such situations, it seems clear that a reduction of food wastage at global, regional, and national scales would have a substantial positive effect on natural and societal resources. Food wastage reduction would not only avoid pressure on scarce natural resources but also decrease the need to raise food production by 60 percent to meet the 2050 population demand.1 Fortunately, different kinds of methods have been proposed for reuse agricultural waste instead of remain in the environment. These residues occurred by processing, production and harvest of cereal products, fruits, vegetables and trees, and through stock farming. They are produced in large amounts worldwide and either burnt in the field or used as animal feed.2 Agricultural residues are lignocellulosic materials.3 Therefore, these wastes are used on production of industrial products such as organic acids, biofuels, protein enriched feed, aroma compounds, bioactive secondary metabolites, microbial pigments, mushroom and enzymes as substrate.4},

abstract = {We present a method for controlled deposition of oriented polymeric nanofibres. The method uses a microfabricated scanned tip as an electrospinning source. The tip is dipped in a polymer solution to gather a droplet as a source material. A voltage applied to the tip causes the formation of a Taylor cone, and at sufficiently high voltages, a polymer jet is extracted from the droplet. By moving the source relative to a surface, acting as a counter-electrode, oriented nanofibres can be deposited and integrated with microfabricated surface structures. For example, we deposited fibres of polyethylene oxide with diameters ranging from 100 to 1800 nm, with the diameter primarily depending on the concentration of the polymeric solution. In addition to the uniform fibre deposition, the scanning tip electrospinning source can produce self-assembled composite fibres of micro- and nanoparticles aligned in a polymeric fibre. We also deposited oriented conductive polymeric fibres of polyaniline and investigated the conductivity of these fibres as components for polymeric nanoelectronics.},

Using a combination of annealing thermal treatment and the wet chemical etching of metal layer a flexible transparent electrode is prepared. Using this high speed and large-area printing technique we can overcome the drawbacks of conventional electrospinning such as fiber structural inhomogeneity, random orientation, and non-reproducible results. In addition, the application of more complicated and expensive methods such as lithography or e-beam lithography or nanoimprint lithography can be avoided using this technique. The most important advantage of the reported fabrication method relative to electro-spinning process is the ability to have a special control on the distribution pattern of the electrodes on the surface which can lead to better control over the ratio of conductivity and transparency of the surface.},

abstract = {A simple patterning process combining near-field electrospinning (NFE) and template lithography, called near-field electrospinning-assisted lithography (NFEAL), was developed to prepare polymeric scaffolds with microgroove patterns for potential use in biomedical applications. NFE enabled the deposition of poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) fibers at a desired position. The diameters of the deposited PEO fibers could be controlled over a range of 0.5–20 $\mu$m by adjusting the NFE parameters such as voltage, distance, feed rate, and translation speed. The preparation of PEO fibers with 1 and 3 $\mu$m diameters using NFE, followed by the deposition of polystyrene (PS) and removal of the fiber template, created free-standing PS scaffolds with microgroove patterns. The width of the microgroove was similar to the diameter of the PEO fibers. The depth of the microgroove was also dependent on the dimensions of the PEO fibers; microgrooves of depth 64.49 ± 11.5 nm and 216.68 ± 62.9 nm were fabricated from PEO fibers of diameters 1 and 3 $\mu$m, respectively. When C2C12 cells were cultured on the microgrooved scaffolds, they showed enhanced elongation or alignment along the microgrooved scaffolds, especially, for the microgroove (1 $\mu$m) with a smaller width.},

abstract = {This study presents a novel droplet-jet mode of near-field electrospinning which allows microscale control of helix patterns using nanofiber. While the cone-jet mode has been used to generate a printable nanofiber to date, the cone-jet mode requires a high applied voltage with a long jet travel distance to obtain the nanofiber, resulting in a large coiling diameter. In order to integrate the near-field electrospinning into microscale devices, it is important to achieve a comparable nanofiber pattern resolution. Herein, we have demonstrated printing of nanofibers with a coiling diameter of sub-10 $\mu$m, which is produced by the droplet-jet mode of near-field electrospinning. Also, it is found that the coiling diameter, wavelength, and frequency can be controlled by the droplet size as one of the process parameters in the droplet-jet mode. The droplet-jet mode will be a promising near-field electrospinning technique to apply direct-written nanofibers to various micro-scale applications.},

In this paper, several multinozzle NFES setups are tested. The experiment reveals that the deposition distance becomes larger when working distance and needle spacing increase, and the influence of voltage is relatively weaker. The deposition of double nozzle NFES has been studied with Coulomb's law and theoretical derivation has been verified by the experimental conclusion. The experiment result and theoretical derivation are helpful to get different distance of direct-written fibers by adjusting working distance or needle spacing to change distance of fibers largely and adjusting voltage to change distance slowly. Through these efforts, it is convenient to adjust the distance of straight fibers in multinozzle system.},

Parameters of interest are voltage, standoff distance, polymer concentration, environmental condition and needle size. From the experimental results, polymer concentration, environmental condition and needle size had influence on achieving a small cylindrical fibre.

The nanochannels fabricated in this study had channel widths ranging from 500 to 1300 nm and depths of 70 to 500 nm, and were patterned in a fashion similar to the wire bonding process routinely used in the semiconductor industry. The nanochannel dimensions were predominantly dictated by electrospun nanofibers, showing that NFES is capable of depositing nanofibers with a diameter down to -50 nm.

abstract = {Near-field electrospinning (NFES) had better controllability than conventional electrospinning. However, due to the lack of guidance of theoretical model, precise deposition of micro/nano fibers could only accomplished by experience. To analyze the behavior of charged jet in NFES using mathematical model, the momentum balance equation was simplified and a new expression between jet cross-sectional radius and axial position was derived. Using this new expression and mass conservation equation, expressions for jet cross-sectional radius and velocity were derived in terms of axial position and initial jet acceleration in the form of exponential functions. Based on Slender-body theory and Giesekus model, a quadratic equation for initial jet acceleration was acquired. With the proposed model, it was able to accurately predict the diameter and velocity of polymer fibers in NFES, and mathematical analysis rather than experimental methods could be applied to study the effects of the process parameters in NFES. Moreover, the movement velocity of the collector stage can be regulated by mathematical model rather than experience. Therefore, the model proposed in this paper had important guiding significance to precise deposition of polymer fibers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).},

abstract = {Cellular behavior is strongly influenced by the architecture and pattern of its interfacing extracellular matrix (ECM). For an artificial culture system which could eventually benefit the translation of scientific findings into therapeutic development, the system should capture the key characteristics of a physiological microenvironment. At the same time, it should also enable standardized, high throughput data acquisition. Since an ECM is composed of different fibrous proteins, studying cellular interaction with individual fibrils will be of physiological relevance. In this study, we employ near-field electrospinning to create ordered patterns of collagenous fibrils of gelatin, based on an acetic acid and ethyl acetate aqueous co-solvent system. Tunable conformations of micro-fibrils were directly deposited onto soft polymeric substrates in a single step. We observe that global topographical features of straight lines, beads-on-strings, and curls are dictated by solution conductivity; whereas the finer details such as the fiber cross-sectional profile are tuned by solution viscosity. Using these fibril constructs as cellular assays, we study EA.hy926 endothelial cells' response to ROCK inhibition, because of ROCK's key role in the regulation of cell shape. The fibril array was shown to modulate the cellular morphology towards a pre-capillary cord-like phenotype, which was otherwise not observed on a flat 2-D substrate. Further facilitated by quantitative analysis of morphological parameters, the fibril platform also provides better dissection in the cells' response to a H1152 ROCK inhibitor. In conclusion, the near-field electrospun fibril constructs provide a more physiologically-relevant platform compared to a featureless 2-D surface, and simultaneously permit statistical single-cell image cytometry using conventional microscopy systems. The patterning approach described here is also expected to form the basics for depositing other protein fibrils, seen among potential applications as culture platforms for drug screening.},

abstract = {Developed from the far field electrospinning (FFES) process, near-field electrospinning (NFES) holds the promise to become a direct-writing technology with high throughput and multi-material capability not only in 2D but also in 3D space. The underlying problem is the deposition of fibers on top of each other. Since the fibers are of sub-micron size, the accuracy of the deposition must reach the same level to realize this requirement. Deposition inaccuracy is attributable to numerous sources including the residual charges remaining on the deposited fibers that repel the fiber being deposited as well as the inappropriate shape of the electric field guiding the deposition process. To eliminate these two influences, this paper proposes two possible solutions. In the first, the polarity of the electrodes is being switched in subsequent deposition passes, while in the second the ground electrode plate is replaced by a grounded pin to modify the shape of the electric field. A comparative experimental analysis of the feasibility of these two methods is presented and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.},

abstract = {This study reports the use of near-field electrospinning to fabricate polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric nanofibers mixed with multiwalled-carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). This study also investigates the mechanical strength and piezoelectric characteristics of a single PVDF/MWCNT nanofiber. The morphology and polarization intensity of piezoelectric fiber can be controlled by adjusting the traveling velocity of the X-Y stage, the DC voltage, and the gap between the needle and collection plate. The optimal parameters of the PVDF solution, such as the PVDF powder weight percentage and MWCNT content, were also determined. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows a high diffraction peak at 2$\theta$ = 20.8° in the piezoelectric crystal $\beta$-phase structure. ANSYS finite element analysis (FEA) software with coupled field analysis was used to realize piezoelectric actuation behavior of the PVDF fibers. A nano-indentation test (NanoIndenter XP System, MTS co.) was used to investigate Young's modulus of the PVDF fiber. Finally, the fixed-fixed beam structures of PVDF composite fibers were tested using a DC voltage supply. Comparing the polarized fiber with non-polarized fibers, the measurement of the center displacements as a function of electric field was conducted and characterized. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this study, a cylindrical near-field electrospinning (CNFES) process was used to fabricate poly($\gamma$-benzyl $\alpha$, l-glutamate) (PBLG) fibers with permanent piezoelectricity. To analyze the piezoelectricity of various PBLG fibers, PBLG weight percentage, rotating tangential speed, electric field, and fiber diameter were investigated. The average diameter of the electrospun PBLG fiber is in the range from 4.37 to 25 $\mu$m with the optimum parameters (PBLG concentration: 18 wt{\%}, tangential collection velocity: 942.4778 mm/s, and electric field: 6×10 6 V/m). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to characterize PBLG nonwoven fiber fabrics (NFFs) made by the CNFES process. The PBLG NFFs with high absorption peak at 1650 cm −1 corresponding to $\alpha$-helix piezoelectric structures were demonstrated. In the experiment, the electrical energy output of one single PBLG fiber was characterized. The maximum power output is 138.42 pW with a load resistance of 8 MΩ. However, one single polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fiber was also tested under the same condition and measurement. The power output is up to 265.81 pW with a load resistance of 6 MΩ. The results show that the power generation of the PVDF fibers exceeds that of PBLG fibers by 68{\%}.},

abstract = {Electrospinning is a powerful method for preparing porous materials that can be applied as biomedical materials for implantation or tissue engineering or as scaffolds for 3D cell culture experiments. However, this technique is limited in practical applications because the pore size of 3D scaffolds directly prepared by conventional electrospinning is usually less than several tens of micrometres, which may not be suitable for 3D cell culture and tissue growth. To allow for satisfactory 3D cell culture and tissue engineering, the pore size of the scaffold should be controllable according to the requirement of the specific cells to be cultured. Here, we show that layer-structured scaffolds with pore sizes larger than 100 $\mu$m can be obtained by stacking meshes prepared by direct-writing using the near-field electrospinning (NFES) technique. In the study, we prepared composite scaffolds made of polycaprolactone (PCL) and hydroxyapatite (HAp) via the above-mentioned method and tested the effectiveness of the novel scaffold in cell culture using mouse pre-osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1). The pore size and the degradability of the PCL/HAp scaffolds were characterized. The results showed that the average pore size of the scaffolds was 167 $\mu$m, which was controllable based on the required application; the degradation rate was controllable depending on the ratio of PCL to HAp. The biocompatibility of the scaffolds in vitro was studied, and it was found that the scaffolds showed no toxicity and that the cells could effectively attach, proliferate, and differentiate in the 3D skeleton of the scaffolds. Our studies showed that a simple modification of the preparation procedure can lead to a new way to fabricate novel layer-structured 3D scaffolds with controllable structures and pore sizes suitable for practical applications in implantation, tissue engineering and 3D cell culture.},

It is shown that the working distance and fibre collector speed have a more significant influence on the deposition of a single jet than the flow rate. In the case of a compound jet, it is shown that jet deposition onto aluminium foil results in a linear fibre form, but on glass slides it appears as a random fibre network. The fabrication of aligned and patterned core-shell structured fibres is demonstrated by coaxial electrospinning of sugar and polycaprolactone (PCL) solutions. Aligned sugar-PCL core-shell fibres with diameters of ∼1.2 $\mu$m are deposited on an x-y translation stage, 10 cm below the coaxial spinneret. Complex patterns of sugar-PCL core-shell fibres with average diameters ranging from 72 to 175 $\mu$m are fabricated by reducing the working distance to 2 cm. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Near-field electrospinning (NFES) was developed to overcome the intrinsic instability of traditional electrospinning processes and to facilitate the controllable deposition of nanofibers under a reduced electric field. This technique offers a straightforward and versatile method for the precision patterning of two-dimensional (2D) nanofibers. However, three-dimensional (3D) stacked structures built by NFES have been limited to either micron-scale sizes or special shapes. Herein, we report on a direct-write 3D NFES technique to construct self-aligned, template-free, 3D stacked nanoarchitectures by simply adding salt to the polymer solution. Numerical simulations suggested that the electric field could be tuned to achieve self-aligned nanofibers by adjusting the conductivity of the polymer solution. This was confirmed experimentally by using poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solutions containing 0.1-1.0 wt{\%} NaCl. Using 0.1 wt{\%} NaCl, nanowalls with a maximum of 80 layers could be built with a width of 92 ± 3 nm, height of 6.6 ± 0.1 $\mu$m, and aspect ratio (height/width) of 72. We demonstrate the 3D printing of nanoskyscrapers with various designs, such as curved "nanowall arrays", nano "jungle gyms," and "nanobridges". Further, we present an application of the 3D stacked nanofiber arrays by preparing transparent and flexible polydimethylsiloxane films embedded with Ag-sputtered nanowalls as 3D nanoelectrodes. The conductivity of the nanoelectrodes can be precisely tuned by adjusting the number of 3D printed layers, without sacrificing transmittance (98.5{\%}). The current NFES approach provides a simple, reliable route to build 3D stacked nanoarchitectures with high-aspect ratios for potential application in smart materials, energy devices, and biomedical applications.},

The ability to precisely control and deposit chitosan-based nanofibers in a direct-write manner is favorable in manipulating cells attachment and proliferation at a preferred position. Experimental results show that fiber diameters can be reliably controlled in the range of 265-1255nm by adjusting various operating parameters of the NFES processes. These prescribed patterns of nanofibers exceed tens of centimeters long and complex configurations such as grid arrays and arc shapes are assembled at specified separations as small as 5m.

abstract = {Nanogenerators capable of converting energy from mechanical sources to electricity with high effective efficiency using low-cost, nonsemiconducting, organic nanomaterials are attractive for many applications, including energy harvesters. In this work, near-field electrospinning is used to direct-write poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers with in situ mechanical stretch and electrical poling characteristics to produce piezoelectric properties. Under mechanical stretching, nanogenerators have shown repeatable and consistent electrical outputs with energy conversion efficiency an order of magnitude higher than those made of PVDF thin films. The early onset of the nonlinear domain wall motions behavior has been identified as one mechanism responsible for the apparent high piezoelectricity in nanofibers. rendering them potentially advantageous for sensing and actuation applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Near-field electrospinning direct writing of array-nozzle is an efficient method for preparing large-area aligned fibers. However, electric field between the array-nozzle interferes with the stability and uniformity of near-field electrospinning, and little research has been done in this field. To clarify the electric field interference generated by array-nozzle, the experimental results compared with the simulation are discussed. In this work, electric field interference between the five-nozzle linear arrangement near-field electrospinning process was demonstrated by the initial ejection behavior, the electric field distribution of near-field electrospinning environment and the deposition spacing of fibers. In addition, we developed a simple and flexible method serving as a quantitative evaluation index for evaluating the degree of electric field interference. Then, the mapping effects of electric field interference of nozzle structure on the surface morphology and uniformity of aligned fibers were studied, including the number of nozzle, nozzle spacing and nozzle length with linear and toothed arrangement. According to the result of experiment and characterization, suitable arrayed nozzle parameters for stably direct-write aligned array pattern with near-field electrospinning were available, whose geometric parameters are linear two-nozzle with a nozzle spacing of 2 mm and a nozzle length of 6.35 mm. Finally, on the basis of our previous research, a microfluidic channel was successfully prepared on polydimethylsiloxane by two-nozzle cooperation, which verified the rationality of the geometry.},

abstract = {Complicated microscale patterns of a continuous nanofiber were precisely fabricated via direct-write near-field electrospinning (NFES). Although NFES could eliminate the bending instability effect by shortening tip-to-collector distance (TTCD) less than the critical length, reported patterns up to the date have been limited to simply aligned straight-lines because of the ignorance of the importance of jet impact speed. To realize the jet impact speed for precise microscale patterning, experimental study of the effect of the process parameters such as applied voltage, TTCD, and an electric field was performed. It has been found that lowering the applied voltage and the TTCD simultaneously could reduce the jet impact speed while keeping the process stable and continuous, resulting in considerable improvement of the accuracy of the deposition. Having the ability to control jet impact speed in NFES will provide the essential foundation to broaden applications of NFES to micro and nanoscale engineering such as an optical waveguide, customized cell culture matrix fabrication to name a few.},

However, it is difficult to control the structural diameter, length, and density of these fibers fabricated by micro/nano-technologies. This work presents a hollow cylindrical near-field electrospinning (HCNFES) process to address production and performance issues encountered previously in either far-field electrospinning (FFES) or near-field electrospinning (NFES) processes. Oriented polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibers in the form of nonwoven fabric have been directly written on a glass tube for aligned piezoelectricity. Under a high in situ electrical poling field and strong mechanical stretching (the tangential speed on the glass tube collector is about 1989.3 mm s −1), the HCNFES process is able to uniformly deposit large arrays of PVDF fibers with good concentrations of piezoelectric $\beta$-phase. The nonwoven fiber fabric (NFF) is transferred onto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate and fixed at both ends using copper foil electrodes as a flexible textile-fiber-based PVDF energy harvester. Repeated stretching and releasing of PVDF NFF with a strain of 0.05{\%} at 7 Hz produces a maximum peak voltage and current at 76 mV and 39 nA, respectively.},

abstract = {Electrospinning is a popular method for creating random, non-woven fibrous templates for biomedical applications, and a subtype technique termed near-field electrospinning (NFES) was devised by reducing the air gap distance to millimeters. This decreased working distance paired with precise translational motion between the fiber source and collector allows for the direct writing of fibers. We demonstrate a near-field electrospinning device designed from a MakerFarm Prusa i3v three-dimensional (3D) printer to write polydioxanone (PDO) microfibers. PDO fiber diameters were characterized over the processing parameters: Air gap, polymer concentration, translational velocity, needle gauge, and applied voltage. Fiber crystallinity and individual fiber uniformity were evaluated for the polymer concentration and translational fiber deposition velocity. Fiber stacking was evaluated for the creation of 3D templates to guide the alignment of human gingival fibroblasts. The fiber diameters correlated positively with polymer concentration, applied voltage, and needle gauge; and inversely correlated with translational velocity and air gap distance. Individual fiber diameter variability decreases, and crystallinity increases with increasing translational fiber deposition velocity. These data resulted in the creation of tailored PDO 3D templates, which guided the alignment of primary human fibroblast cells. Together, these results suggest that NFES of PDO can be scaled to create precise geometries with tailored fiber diameters for biomedical applications.},

How to decrease the line width and improve the deposition accuracy of direct-written patterns has been the key to the promotion for the further application of EDW. In this paper, an airflow-assisted spinneret for electrohydrodynamic direct-writing was designed. An assisted laminar airflow was introduced to the EDW process, which provided an additional stretching and constraining force on the jet to reduce the surrounding interferences and enhance jet stability. The flow field and the electric field around the spinneret were simulated to direct the structure design of the airflow-assisted spinneret. Then, a series of experiments were conducted, and the results verified the spinneret design and demonstrated a stable ejection of jet in the EDW process. With assisted airflow, the uniformity of printed patterns and the deposition position accuracy of a charged jet can be improved. Complex patterns with positioning errors of less than 5{\%} have been printed and characterized, which provide an effective way to promote the integration of micro/nanosystems.},

abstract = {Electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) is a key research area for producing micro and nano-sized structures. This process can be categorized into two main operating regimes: electrospraying for particle generation and electrospinning for fibre production. Producing particles/fibres of the desired size or morphology depends on two main factors; properties of the polymeric solution used and the processing conditions including flow rate, applied voltage and collection distance. In this work the particle-fibre transition region was analyzed by changing the polymer concentration of PLGA poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) in acetone between 2 and 25 wt{\%}. Subsequently the processing conditions were adjusted to study the optimum transition parameters. Additionally the EHDA configuration was also modified by adding a metallic plate to observe the deposition area. The diameter and the distance of the plate from the capillary tip were adjusted to investigate variations in particle and fibre morphologies as well. It was found that complete transition from particles to fibres occurs at 20 wt{\%} indicating concentration to be the dominant criterion. Low flow rates yielded fibres without beads. However the applied voltage and distance between the tip of the nozzle jetting the polymer solution and collector (working distance) did not yield definitive results. Reducing the collector distance and increasing applied voltages produces smooth as well as beaded fibres. Addition of a metal plate reduces particle size by ∼ 1 $\mu$m; the fibre size increases especially with increasing plate diameter while bead density and size reduces when the disc is fixed closer to the capillary tip. Additionally, the deposition area is reduced by 70{\%} and 57{\%} with the addition of metal plates of 30 mm and 60 mm, respectively. The results indicate that a metal plate can be utilized further to tune the particle/fibre size and morphology and this also significantly increases the yield of EHDA process which is currently a limitation in adopting it as a mass production technique.},

The fibers, made by poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene], have diameters of few hundreds of nanometers and emission peaked at 560 nm. The observed blue-shift compared to the emission from reference films is attributed to different polymer packing in the nanostructures. Optical confinement in the fibers is also analyzed through self-waveguided emission. These results open interesting perspectives for realizing complex and ordered architectures by light-emitting nanofibers, such as photonic circuits, and for the precise positioning and integration of conjugated polymer fibers into light-emitting devices.},

abstract = {A mechano-electrospinning method is presented to direct-write oriented nanofiber with high deposition accuracy in continuously tunable manner. This method uses a large nozzle to deposit high-resolution fiber-arrays by near-field localization. Due to the existence of mechanical drawing force, a higher resolution pattern can be direct-written by a lower voltage, which just keeps the Taylor cone stable. Then the fiber is stretched through a moving substrate, by which the deposited fiber can be continuously tuned from 400 nm to 200 nm in a linear relationship. The effects of the speed on the diameter and morphology of fibers are studied, and the analysis of the mechanism of the fiber alignment is given. The positionability and controllability make mechano-electrospinning very different from the traditional electrospinning, which only collects the fibers in the form of nonwoven fabric. In addition, the fibers fabricated by this method can directly deposit over a large flat area in the form of arrays and complex patterns with high precision.},

abstract = {Nowadays it is easy to imagine that the exploitation of different additive manufacturing approaches could find use in regenerative medicine and frontiers nanotechnology with a strong interest in the development of in vivo bio-incubators that better replicate the tissue environment. Various electrospinning technologies have been exploited for the fabrication of composite polymeric architectures, where fibers have been used for the construction layer by layer of micro-architectures. Unfortunately, in case of processing biomaterials, the intrinsic factors of the materials could become obstacles when considering such advanced engineering methods. Here, for the first time, we use the pyro-EHD process for the fabrication of layered three-dimensional architectures made using a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer. The proposed approach for layered 3D printing works at mild temperature allowing deposition at high resolution and great flexibility in manufacturing, avoiding high voltage generators, and nozzles. The layered 3D printing, activated by the pyro-electric effect, is discussed and characterized in terms of geometrical features and processing parameters. Different geometries and micro-architecture (wall, square, triangle, and hybrid structures) have been demonstrated and over printing of composite polymer, obtained by mixing multiwall carbon nanotubes and fluorochrome, has been discussed, focusing on the use of a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer.},

abstract = {HYPOTHESIS The electrostatic initiation of a jet from the meniscus of a polymeric solution is a key step in near-field electrospinning (NFES), however this process is not sufficiently understood to determine a criterion for the critical emitter voltage triggering the jet, nor to optimize the electrodes. It is expected that the jet initiation in NFES is similar to that in cone-jet electrosprays, and can be described with a first principles model. EXPERIMENTS The electrostatic jet initiation of an SU-8 polymeric solution is studied with two different electrode geometries to quantify the initiation parameters and illustrate the optimization of the electric field. A first-principles model is developed to predict and analyze the initiation. FINDINGS Two jet emission mechanisms are identified: one in which the jet is ejected from a free-standing conical meniscus; and one resulting from the contact of the meniscus with the collector, as it evolves from a spherical to a conical shape. Both are triggered by a critical emitter potential. The former produces the thinnest jets with a diameter that depends on the properties of the fluid, while the latter is an alternative to existing mechanical initiation methods. The model reproduces well the experimental phenomena including the critical voltage.},

Gas response to NO2 in the range 1-10 ppm and 100-300°C operating temperature (OT) has shown best practical sensor sensitivity (S = RG/RA) at a relatively low OT (150°C) and detection limits down to 1 ppm gas.

Here we manufactured scaffolds of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline), a hydrophilic polymer with high melting temperature, by MEW for the first time. We systematically varied and investigated the crucial instrument parameters: heating temperature (200-220 °C), feeding pressure (1.0-3.0 bar), accelerating voltage (3.0-7.0 kV) and collector distance (3.0-7.0 mm) in dependence of differently sized spinnerets (23 G, 25 G, 27 G, 30 G). As criteria for homogeneous deposition, we studied the resulting fiber diameters which could be adjusted from 8 $\mu$m to 138 $\mu$m and the corresponding variances. Furthermore this letter clarifies the need of a dynamic balance between involved mass flows in order to reduce pulsing failures of the jet and thereby structural defects of the deposited structures.},

abstract = {Melt electrospinning and its additive manufacturing analogue, melt electrospinning writing (MEW), are two processes which can produce porous materials for applications where solvent toxicity and accumulation in solution electrospinning are problematic. This study explores the melt electrospinning of poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds, specifically for applications in tissue engineering. The research described here aims to inform researchers interested in melt electrospinning about technical aspects of the process. This includes rapid fiber characterization using glass microscope slides, allowing influential processing parameters on fiber morphology to be assessed, as well as observed fiber collection phenomena on different collector substrates. The distribution and alignment of melt electrospun PCL fibers can be controlled to a certain degree using patterned collectors to create large numbers of scaffolds with shaped macroporous architectures. However, the buildup of residual charge in the collected fibers limits the achievable thickness of the porous template through such scaffolds. One challenge identified for MEW is the ability to control charge buildup so that fibers can be placed accurately in close proximity, and in many centimeter heights. The scale and size of scaffolds produced using MEW, however, indicate that this emerging process will fill a technological niche in biofabrication.},

abstract = {We herein report a high-resolution nanopatterning method using low voltage electromechanical spinning with a rotating collector to obtain aligned graphitized micro and nanowires for carbon nanomanufacturing. A small wire diameter and a small inter-wire spacing were obtained by controlling the electric field, the spinneret-to-collector distance, the pyrolysis parameters, the linear speed of the spinneret, the rotational speed of the collector. Using a simple scaling analysis, we show how the straightness and the diameter of the wires can be controlled by the electric field and the distance of the spinneret to the collector. A small inter-wire spacing, as predicted by a simple model, was achieved by simultaneously controlling the linear speed of the spinneret and the rotational speed of the collector. Rapid drying of the polymer nanowires enabled the facile fabrication of suspended wires over various structures. Patterned polyacrylonitrile wires were carbonized using standard stabilization and pyrolysis to obtain carbon nanowires. Suspended carbon nanowires with a diameter of {\textless}50 nm were obtained. We also established a method for making patterned, highly graphitized structures by using the aforementioned carbon wire structures as a template for chemical vapor deposition of graphite. This patterning technique offers high throughput for nano writing, which outperforms other existing nanopatterning techniques, making it a potential candidate for large-scale carbon nanomanufacturing.},

abstract = {A near-field electrospinning (NFES) process has been developed to deposit solid nanofibers in a direct, continuous, and controllable manner. A tungsten electrode with tip diameter of 25 $\mu$m is used to construct nanofibers of 50-500 nm line width on silicon-based collectors while the liquid polymer solution is supplied in a manner analogous to that of a dip pen. The minimum applied bias voltage is 600 V, and minimum electrode-to-collector distance is 500 $\mu$m to achieve position controllable deposition. Charged nanofibers can be orderly collected, making NFES a potential tool in direct write nanofabrication for a variety of materials. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Nanotubes assembled from macrocyclic precursors offer a unique combination of low dimensionality, structural rigidity, and distinct interior and exterior microenvironments. Usually the weak stacking energies of macrocycles limit the length or strength of the resultant nanotubes. Imine-linked macrocycles were recently found to assemble into high-aspect ratio ({\textgreater}10 3), lyotropic nanotubes in the presence of excess acid. Yet these harsh conditions are incompatible with many functional groups and processing methods, and lower acid loadings instead catalyze macrocycle degradation. Here we report pyridine-2,6-diimine-linked macrocycles that assemble into high-aspect ratio nanotubes in the presence of less than 1 equiv of CF3CO2H per macrocycle. Analysis by gel permeation chromatography and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed a cooperative self-assembly mechanism. Nanofibers obtained by touch-spinning the pyridinium-based nanotubes exhibit Young's mod-uli of 1.48 GPa, which exceeds that of many synthetic polymers and biological filaments. These findings will enable the design of structurally diverse nanotubes from synthetically accessible macrocycles.},

Cell spreading in preferential direction could be observed on parallel-aligned nanofibers, and the CNF patterns were capable of guiding cell extension when the distances between them are 20 and 100 $\mu$m, respectively. Alignment of the cells was characterized according to their elongation and orientation using the fast Fourier transform data and binary image analysis. Parallel CNF indicates that the alignment values sequentially increased as a function of positioning density such that incrementally more aligned cells were closely related to the increasing CNF positioning density. These maskless, low-cost, and direct-write patterns can be facily fabricated and will be a promising tool to study cell-based research such as cell adhesion, spreading, and tissue architecture.},

The method, dubbed "biased AC electrospinning", employs a combination of DC and AC potentials and results in highly-aligned mats of polymer or composite polymer fibers. The relationship between specific processing variables such as the AC frequency and the magnitude of the DC offset was investigated and related to the resulting fiber stability and uniformity. For optimum fiber stability, the AC frequency must fall within a relatively narrow range. The upper and lower frequency limits were measured for a small group of polymers and polymer composites and were qualitatively related to solution properties and processing variables. Potential applications of well-ordered nanofiber materials include tissue engineering, filtration, drug delivery, and microelectronics.},

abstract = {Electrospinning is recognized as an efficient and versatile technique that has been widely used in nanoscale fiber fabrication. Electric field manipulation is one of the efficient ways to precisely control an electrospinning jet. While there have been several studies of the electric field manipulation effect on nanofiber deposition control, these works are limited to the control of a far-field electrospinning (FFES) jet to deposit in one dimension or to suppress the chaotic whipping mode to some extent. Few work has been done to control a near-field electrospinning (NFES) jet for deposition of complex patterns using electric field manipulation. To this end, we propose a novel design by adding a moving sharp-pin electrode beneath the plane collector. The sharp pin electrode is charged with a positive voltage and moved to redistribute the electric field for jet trajectory control, while the plane collector is kept stationary. The focusing of the electric field and the guiding effect of the jet trajectory due to the additional sharp-pin electrode are studied and demonstrated. Various parameters (voltage, electrode translation speed, and collection mechanism) are analyzed to experimentally study their effects on the fiber deposition control. It is demonstrated in the current work the feasibility of controlling a single fiber for deposition of complex patterns in near-field electrospinning by manipulating the electric field distribution.},

abstract = {AC pulse-modulated electrohydrodynamic direct-writing (EDW) was utilized to direct-write orderly micro/nanofibrous structure on the flexible insulating polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. During the EDW process, AC electrical field induced charges to reciprocate along the jet and decreased the charge repulsive force that applied on charged jet. Thanks to the smaller charge repulsive force, stable straight jet can be built up to direct-write orderly micro/nanofibrous structures on the insulating substrate. The minimum motion velocity required to direct-write straight line fibrous structure on insulating PET substrate was 700 mm/s. Moreover, the influences of AC voltage amplitude, frequency, and duty cycle ratio on the line width of fibrous structures were investigated. This work proposes a novel solution to overcome the inherent charge repulsion emerging on the insulating substrate, and promotes the application of EDW technology on the flexible electronics.},

abstract = {Both experiment and simulation works were utilized to research the deposition behavior of single coiled nanofiber on silicon substrate from Near-Field Electrospinning (NFES). In the experiment process, when the collector moving speed (CMS) is compatible with electrospinning speed, straight line nanofiber can be collected. When CMS decreases, jet would step into whipping motion due to the imbalance charge repulsive force from landed nanofiber. As decreasing CMS, nanofiber in waved shape, single circle coil and multi-circle coil can be fabricated in turn. In order to improve the controlling technology, a computational model based on Maxwell viscoelastic theory was build up to analyzed the deposition behavior of single nanofiber. Simulation results show that CMS is the main controlling parameter influence the nanofiber deposition morphology: beads deposited in straight line, when CMS higher than 0.35m/s; beads deposited in waved shape, when CMS lies between 0.15m/s and 0.35m/s; beads in single-circle coiled can be gained, when CMS ranges from 0.08m/s to 0.15m/s; beads would deposit in multi-circle coil, when CMS lower than 0.08m/s. The effect of collector conductivity was also investigated by the computational modeling: the diameter of multi-circle nanofiber zone and distance between adjacent nanofiber coil increases with collector conductivity decrease. The calculated behaviors of nanofiber deposition are in good agreement with the experimental results, which is a good way to represent the motion behavior of charged jet and nanofiber. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {The mechanical characterization of the electrospinning polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nonwoven fiber fabrics (NFFs) doped with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was investigated. Piezoelectric composite nanofibers of the PVDF/MWCNTs were directly electrospun by the hollow cylindrical near-field electrospinning (HCNFES) without any post-poling treatment. We have made the HCNFES NFFs consisted of high-orderly arranged nanofiber assemblies for further characterizing the effect of MWCNTs filling PVDF nanofibers. An in situ electrical poling and high uniaxial stretching imparted on the polymer jet during the HCNFES process, which naturally align the dipoles in the PVDF crystals and promote the formation of the polar $\beta$-crystalline phase within the fibers. Moreover, the reinforcement of the HCNFES PVDF nanofibers indicated the improvement in mechanical properties and the degree of high oriented extended-chain crystallites through adding adequate contents of MWCNTs. In the case of alignment of the all-trans polymer chains in the vicinity of MWCNTs along the fiber axis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed the strongest diffraction peak of the $\beta$-crystalline phase. In the comparison of the near-field electrospinning (NFES), the HCNFES nanofibers with smooth surface and smaller diameter can easily form high density structural NFFs. After nano-indentation and tensile strength measurements, the results indicated that the mechanical properties of the HCNFES NFFs are better than the NFES ones. When 16 wt{\%} PVDF solution doped with 0.03 wt{\%} MWCNTs, the results reveal that Young's modulus, hardness, yield stress, yield strain, ultimate tensile strength, and strain at break of the HCNFES composite NFFs are obviously enhanced to 1.39 GPa, 39.6 MPa, 28 MPa, 48.17 MPa, 3.3{\%}, and 32.5{\%}, respectively. Finally, a flexible wearable sensor made of three-dimensional piezoelectric NFFs was actually experimented. Outstanding mechanical properties with highly deformable of PVDF/MWCNTs composite nanofibers would maintain it to represent great challenges during practical implementation.},

Using a combination of annealing thermal treatment and the wet chemical etching of metal layer a flexible transparent electrode is prepared. Using this high speed and large-area printing technique we can overcome the drawbacks of conventional electrospinning such as fiber structural inhomogeneity, random orientation, and non-reproducible results. In addition, the application of more complicated and expensive methods such as lithography or e-beam lithography or nanoimprint lithography can be avoided using this technique. The most important advantage of the reported fabrication method relative to electro-spinning process is the ability to have a special control on the distribution pattern of the electrodes on the surface which can lead to better control over the ratio of conductivity and transparency of the surface.},
