abstract = {We report on a continuous method for controlled electrospinning of polymeric nanofibers on two-dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) substrates using low voltage near-field electrospinning (LV NFES). The method overcomes some of the drawbacks in more conventional near-field electrospinning by using a superelastic polymer ink formulation. The viscoelastic nature of our polymer ink enables continuous electrospinning at a very low voltage of 200 V, almost an order of magnitude lower than conventional NFES, thereby reducing bending instabilities and increasing control of the resulting polymer jet. In one application, polymeric nanofibers are freely suspended between microstructures of 3D carbon on Si substrates to illustrate wiring together 3D components in any desired pattern.},

The fibers, made by poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene], have diameters of few hundreds of nanometers and emission peaked at 560 nm. The observed blue-shift compared to the emission from reference films is attributed to different polymer packing in the nanostructures. Optical confinement in the fibers is also analyzed through self-waveguided emission. These results open interesting perspectives for realizing complex and ordered architectures by light-emitting nanofibers, such as photonic circuits, and for the precise positioning and integration of conjugated polymer fibers into light-emitting devices.},

Helix electrohydrodynamic printing (HE-printing) has been proposed here to realize controllable direct-writing of large area, highly aligned serpentine micro/nanofibers by introducing the rope coiling effect into printing process. By manipulating the flying trajectory and solidification degree of the micro/nano jet, the solidified micro/nanofiber flying in a stabilized helical manner and versatile serpentine structures deposited on a moving collector have been achieved. Systematic experiments and theoretical analysis were conducted to study the transformation behavior and the size changing rules for various deposited microstructures, and highly aligned serpentine microfibers were directly written by controlling the applied voltage, nozzle-to-collector distance and collector velocity. Furthermore, a hyper-stretchable piezoelectric device that can detect stretching, bending and pressure has been successfully fabricated using the printed serpentine micro/nanofibers, demonstrating the potential of HE-printing in stretchable electronics manufacturing.},

How to decrease the line width and improve the deposition accuracy of direct-written patterns has been the key to the promotion for the further application of EDW. In this paper, an airflow-assisted spinneret for electrohydrodynamic direct-writing was designed. An assisted laminar airflow was introduced to the EDW process, which provided an additional stretching and constraining force on the jet to reduce the surrounding interferences and enhance jet stability. The flow field and the electric field around the spinneret were simulated to direct the structure design of the airflow-assisted spinneret. Then, a series of experiments were conducted, and the results verified the spinneret design and demonstrated a stable ejection of jet in the EDW process. With assisted airflow, the uniformity of printed patterns and the deposition position accuracy of a charged jet can be improved. Complex patterns with positioning errors of less than 5{\%} have been printed and characterized, which provide an effective way to promote the integration of micro/nanosystems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {One-dimensional piezoelectric nanomaterials have attracted great attention in recent years for their possible applications in mechanical energy scavenging devices. However, it is difficult to control the structural diameter, length, and density of these fibers fabricated by micro/nano-technologies. This work presents a hollow cylindrical near-field electrospinning (HCNFES) process to address production and performance issues encountered previously in either far-field electrospinning (FFES) or near-field electrospinning (NFES) processes. Oriented polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibers in the form of nonwoven fabric have been directly written on a glass tube for aligned piezoelectricity. Under a high in situ electrical poling field and strong mechanical stretching (the tangential speed on the glass tube collector is about 1989.3 mm s â1), the HCNFES process is able to uniformly deposit large arrays of PVDF fibers with good concentrations of piezoelectric $\beta$-phase. The nonwoven fiber fabric (NFF) is transferred onto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate and fixed at both ends using copper foil electrodes as a flexible textile-fiber-based PVDF energy harvester. Repeated stretching and releasing of PVDF NFF with a strain of 0.05{\%} at 7 Hz produces a maximum peak voltage and current at 76 mV and 39 nA, respectively.},

abstract = {In this study, a cylindrical near-field electrospinning (CNFES) process was used to fabricate poly($\gamma$-benzyl $\alpha$, l-glutamate) (PBLG) fibers with permanent piezoelectricity. To analyze the piezoelectricity of various PBLG fibers, PBLG weight percentage, rotating tangential speed, electric field, and fiber diameter were investigated. The average diameter of the electrospun PBLG fiber is in the range from 4.37 to 25 $\mu$m with the optimum parameters (PBLG concentration: 18 wt{\%}, tangential collection velocity: 942.4778 mm/s, and electric field: 6Ã10 6 V/m). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to characterize PBLG nonwoven fiber fabrics (NFFs) made by the CNFES process. The PBLG NFFs with high absorption peak at 1650 cm â1 corresponding to $\alpha$-helix piezoelectric structures were demonstrated. In the experiment, the electrical energy output of one single PBLG fiber was characterized. The maximum power output is 138.42 pW with a load resistance of 8 Mâ¦. However, one single polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fiber was also tested under the same condition and measurement. The power output is up to 265.81 pW with a load resistance of 6 Mâ¦. The results show that the power generation of the PVDF fibers exceeds that of PBLG fibers by 68{\%}.},

Deposition inaccuracy is attributable to numerous sources including the residual charges remaining on the deposited fibers that repel the fiber being deposited as well as the inappropriate shape of the electric field guiding the deposition process. To eliminate these two influences, this paper proposes two possible solutions. In the first, the polarity of the electrodes is being switched in subsequent deposition passes, while in the second the ground electrode plate is replaced by a grounded pin to modify the shape of the electric field. A comparative experimental analysis of the feasibility of these two methods is presented and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.},

abstract = {Cellular behavior is strongly influenced by the architecture and pattern of its interfacing extracellular matrix (ECM). For an artificial culture system which could eventually benefit the translation of scientific findings into therapeutic development, the system should capture the key characteristics of a physiological microenvironment. At the same time, it should also enable standardized, high throughput data acquisition. Since an ECM is composed of different fibrous proteins, studying cellular interaction with individual fibrils will be of physiological relevance. In this study, we employ near-field electrospinning to create ordered patterns of collagenous fibrils of gelatin, based on an acetic acid and ethyl acetate aqueous co-solvent system. Tunable conformations of micro-fibrils were directly deposited onto soft polymeric substrates in a single step. We observe that global topographical features of straight lines, beads-on-strings, and curls are dictated by solution conductivity; whereas the finer details such as the fiber cross-sectional profile are tuned by solution viscosity. Using these fibril constructs as cellular assays, we study EA.hy926 endothelial cells' response to ROCK inhibition, because of ROCK's key role in the regulation of cell shape. The fibril array was shown to modulate the cellular morphology towards a pre-capillary cord-like phenotype, which was otherwise not observed on a flat 2-D substrate. Further facilitated by quantitative analysis of morphological parameters, the fibril platform also provides better dissection in the cells' response to a H1152 ROCK inhibitor. In conclusion, the near-field electrospun fibril constructs provide a more physiologically-relevant platform compared to a featureless 2-D surface, and simultaneously permit statistical single-cell image cytometry using conventional microscopy systems. The patterning approach described here is also expected to form the basics for depositing other protein fibrils, seen among potential applications as culture platforms for drug screening.},

abstract = {AC pulse-modulated electrohydrodynamic direct-writing (EDW) was utilized to direct-write orderly micro/nanofibrous structure on the flexible insulating polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. During the EDW process, AC electrical field induced charges to reciprocate along the jet and decreased the charge repulsive force that applied on charged jet. Thanks to the smaller charge repulsive force, stable straight jet can be built up to direct-write orderly micro/nanofibrous structures on the insulating substrate. The minimum motion velocity required to direct-write straight line fibrous structure on insulating PET substrate was 700 mm/s. Moreover, the influences of AC voltage amplitude, frequency, and duty cycle ratio on the line width of fibrous structures were investigated. This work proposes a novel solution to overcome the inherent charge repulsion emerging on the insulating substrate, and promotes the application of EDW technology on the flexible electronics.},

abstract = {Electrospinning is a straightforward method to produce micro/nanoscale fibers from polymer solutions typically using an operating voltage of 10 kV - 30 kV and spinning distance of 10 cm - 20 cm. In this paper, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) non-woven nanofibers with diameters of 200 nm - 900 nm were prepared by low-voltage near-field electrospinning with a working voltage of less than 2.8 kV and a spinning distance of less than 10 mm. Besides the uniform fibers, beaded-fibers were also fabricated and the formation mechanism was discussed. Particularly, a series of experiments were carried out to explore the influence of processing variables on the formation of near-field electrospun PVP nanofibers, including concentration, humidity, collecting position, and spinning distance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.},
