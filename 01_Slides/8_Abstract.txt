Carbon nano-wires are versatile materials composed of carbon chains with a wide range of applications due to their high conductivity. Regardless of the high interest in the implementation of carbon nano-wires in several applications and devices, no feasible processes have been developed to fabricate carbon nano-wires with spatial control at a reasonable cost. Carbon nano-wires have been fabricated with the use of a photoresist, but little is known about polymers that can produce more conductive carbon nano-wires after pyrolysis. Various polymer solutions have been tested in near field electrospinning (NFES) and photopolymerization separately, however, few have been tested for nano-wire fabrication purposes through pyrolysis. The intention behind the thesis proposal is to implement rheology analyses of different polymer solutions to determine if they can be easily electrospun at low voltages and then fabricate nano-wires with them. This thesis work arises from the need to test a greater variety of polymers with the goal to design a polymer solution to fabricate carbon nano-wires with better conductivity than the current SU-8 polymeric nano-fibers. The research process will include the design of polymer solutions that can be electrospun, photopolymerized, and then pyrolyzed into conducting carbon nanowires. On the other hand, it is intended to engineer a newly designed polymer solution to achieve mass scale manufacturing of conductive carbon nano-wires in an inexpensive, continuous, simple and reproducible manner as central components for nano-sensors.
