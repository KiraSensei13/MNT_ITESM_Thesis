abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effect of laser fluence on a negative tone thin film resist, SU-8, using an all-fibre 405 nm laser direct writing technique. 405 nm Gaussian beam is delivered on the spin-coated SU-8 thin film using single mode fibre, followed by subsequent chemical developing process. Disc structure is formed where its dimension is affected by the laser fluence. We found that polymer processing using this technique can be categorized into three stages. In the first stage (fluence {\textgreater} 90 J/cm2), lens shaped structure is formed with linear increase in diameter with logarithmic increase in laser fluence. In second stage (fluence {\textgreater} 600 J/cm2), flat-top disc structure is formed and the increase in disc diameter slows down with increasing laser fluence. In the third stage (fluence {\textgreater} 49 kJ/cm2), crater is formed at the centre of the disc due to laser ablation. Moreover, relatively large exposure fluence above the value required for complete polymerization has allowed collateral thermal-polymerization of the surrounding of the disc structure and reduced aspect ratio of the structure. Hence, by controlling laser writing fluence, different structures mentioned above can be produced. This understanding serves as a basis for polymer patterning using the proposed all-fibre laser direct writing technique, which finds potential application in micro-lens array, polymer optical waveguide, photomask and Lab-On-Chip fabrication.},

abstract = {A novel method for the direct fabrication of arrays of micropatterned polymeric and carbon nanofiber structures on any substrate is developed. First SU-8, an epoxy-based negative photoresist, is electrospun under optimized conditions to produce a layer of polymeric nanofibers. Next, this nanofibrous mat is micropatterned using photolithography, and finally, pyrolysis produces ordered arrays of microdomains containing carbon nanofibers. The nanotextured surfaces of carbon nanofibers are shown to be very hydrophobic (water contact angle approximately 130 degrees). Micropatterning thus generates a substantial wettability contrast of nanofiber domains with intervening micropatches of very hydrophilic carbon (approximately 20 degrees) or silicon substrates.},

abstract = {A continuous near-field electrospinning (NFES) process has been developed to deposit solid nanofibers with orderly patterns over large areas. Before the onset of electrospinning, a bias voltage is applied to a semispherical shaped polymerdroplet outside of a syringe needle, and a probe tip mechanically draws a single fiber from the droplet to initiate continuous NFES. Contrary to the conventional electrospinning process, we show that decreasing electrical field in continuous NFES results in smaller linewidth deposition, and nanofibers can be assembled into controlled complex patterns such as circular shapes and grid arrays on large and flat areas.},

@article{Cardenas2017,
abstract = {Over the last couple of decades, Carbon Nanowires (CNWs) have found important applications in the field of rapid label-free biosensing platforms for their excellent electrical, thermal and chemical properties. Despite the growing interest in incorporating these materials into sensitive analytical devices, there has been limited research efforts that explore the realistic incorporation of these structures into broader microsystems. The present dissertation explores two Advanced Additive Manufacturing (AdAM) techniques for the fabrication of CNWs with promising characteristics for sensing applications. The first technique, Electro-Mechanical Spinning (EMS) is a relatively new method for the production of CNWs with highly-oriented patterning capabilities, and is assessed in terms of the minimum feature sizes that it can attain reproducibly. The second method, Multiple Photon Polymerization (MPP) is a mature laser manufacturing technique that offers high repeatability, yet it has remained largely unexplored in the field of carbon materials. This work presents a study of how MPP can be used to create CNWs in terms of micro-fabrication parameters like laser power and scanning velocity. A thorough review study of the surface properties required for carbon materials to become eligible candidates in biosensing is also included in this dissertation. Lastly, an application of CNWs is presented, in which a Joule Heating technique is used to induce controlled breaking of the wires to produce nano-scale separated carbon electrodes, which hold potential for micro/nano particle manipulation in microfluidics.},
