abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effect of laser fluence on a negative tone thin film resist, SU-8, using an all-fibre 405 nm laser direct writing technique. 405 nm Gaussian beam is delivered on the spin-coated SU-8 thin film using single mode fibre, followed by subsequent chemical developing process. Disc structure is formed where its dimension is affected by the laser fluence. We found that polymer processing using this technique can be categorized into three stages. In the first stage (fluence {\textgreater} 90 J/cm2), lens shaped structure is formed with linear increase in diameter with logarithmic increase in laser fluence. In second stage (fluence {\textgreater} 600 J/cm2), flat-top disc structure is formed and the increase in disc diameter slows down with increasing laser fluence. In the third stage (fluence {\textgreater} 49 kJ/cm2), crater is formed at the centre of the disc due to laser ablation. Moreover, relatively large exposure fluence above the value required for complete polymerization has allowed collateral thermal-polymerization of the surrounding of the disc structure and reduced aspect ratio of the structure. Hence, by controlling laser writing fluence, different structures mentioned above can be produced. This understanding serves as a basis for polymer patterning using the proposed all-fibre laser direct writing technique, which finds potential application in micro-lens array, polymer optical waveguide, photomask and Lab-On-Chip fabrication.},

abstract = {A novel method for the direct fabrication of arrays of micropatterned polymeric and carbon nanofiber structures on any substrate is developed. First SU-8, an epoxy-based negative photoresist, is electrospun under optimized conditions to produce a layer of polymeric nanofibers. Next, this nanofibrous mat is micropatterned using photolithography, and finally, pyrolysis produces ordered arrays of microdomains containing carbon nanofibers. The nanotextured surfaces of carbon nanofibers are shown to be very hydrophobic (water contact angle approximately 130 degrees). Micropatterning thus generates a substantial wettability contrast of nanofiber domains with intervening micropatches of very hydrophilic carbon (approximately 20 degrees) or silicon substrates.},

Before the onset of electrospinning, a bias voltage is applied to a semispherical shaped polymerdroplet outside of a syringe needle, and a probe tip mechanically draws a single fiber from the droplet to initiate continuous NFES. Contrary to the conventional electrospinning process, we show that decreasing electrical field in continuous NFES results in smaller linewidth deposition, and nanofibers can be assembled into controlled complex patterns such as circular shapes and grid arrays on large and flat areas.},

abstract = {Over the last couple of decades, Carbon Nanowires (CNWs) have found important applications in the field of rapid label-free biosensing platforms for their excellent electrical, thermal and chemical properties. Despite the growing interest in incorporating these materials into sensitive analytical devices, there has been limited research efforts that explore the realistic incorporation of these structures into broader microsystems. The present dissertation explores two Advanced Additive Manufacturing (AdAM) techniques for the fabrication of CNWs with promising characteristics for sensing applications. The first technique, Electro-Mechanical Spinning (EMS) is a relatively new method for the production of CNWs with highly-oriented patterning capabilities, and is assessed in terms of the minimum feature sizes that it can attain reproducibly. The second method, Multiple Photon Polymerization (MPP) is a mature laser manufacturing technique that offers high repeatability, yet it has remained largely unexplored in the field of carbon materials. This work presents a study of how MPP can be used to create CNWs in terms of micro-fabrication parameters like laser power and scanning velocity. A thorough review study of the surface properties required for carbon materials to become eligible candidates in biosensing is also included in this dissertation. Lastly, an application of CNWs is presented, in which a Joule Heating technique is used to induce controlled breaking of the wires to produce nano-scale separated carbon electrodes, which hold potential for micro/nano particle manipulation in microfluidics.},

Among the various precursors to produce CNFs, PAN has been extensively studied due to its high carbon yield and flexibility for tailoring the structure of the final CNFs as well as the ease of obtaining stabilized products due to the formation of a ladder structure via nitrile polymerization. In view of this, they have applications in areas such as electronics, tissue engineering, membrane filtration and high performance composites. This review presents various combinations of PAN and PAN-based precursors in producing CNFs from the PAN homopolymer or its modified precursors, copolymers, blends and various composites. Various modifications of PAN and their future prospects in different scientific and technological disciplines are addressed.},

abstract = {Pyrolysis is the process to thermally decompose an organic material into its carbon backbone in an oxygen-free environment. This process is used in the Carbon-MEMS fabrication technology to carbonize micro-structures patterned on a substrate. The properties of the resulting carbon material are dependent on either the carbon precursor or the pyrolysis conditions. In this work, SU-8 photoresist was used as the carbon precursor to study the effects of three pyrolysis parameters: 1) maximum pyrolysis temperature (600°C, 700°C, 800°C, and 900°C), 2) temperature ramp rate (2.5°C/min, 5°C/min, 10°C/min, and 20°C/min), and 3) nitrogen flow rate (3l/min, 4.5l/min, 6l/min, and 7.5l/min). To studythe effect of the maximum temperature, the temperature ramp rate and nitrogen flow rate were kept constant to 5°C/min and 6l/min respectively. For the temperature ramp rate experiments, we kept the maximum pyrolysis temperature and nitrogen flow rate constant to 900°C and 6l/min respectively. For the nitrogen flow rate study, the maximum pyrolysis temperature and temperature ramp rate were kept constant to 900°C and 5°C/min respectively. We found that no polymer structures persisted under the following conditions: 900°C maximum pyrolysis temperature, 5°C/min temperature ramp rate, and 3l/min nitrogen flow rate. Under these conditions the nitrogen flow rate is not high enough to keep the furnace environment (approximate volume of the furnace tube we used is 6l) entirely inert; in the pyrolysis process, even a small amount of oxygen destroys the intended C-MEMS. All the carbon samples were characterized using 4-point probe measurement for electrical resistivity; confocal microscopy for pore size determination; Raman spectroscopy, electron diffraction x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for chemical characterization. Furthermore, the samples were electrochemically characterized using cyclic voltammetry in a 1mM K4Fe(CN)6 and 0.5M KCl solution. The characterization results suggest that samples prepared under the following conditions - 900°C maximum pyrolysis temperature, 5°C/min temperature ramp rate, and 6l/min nitrogen flow rate, exhibit the best electrical, physical, chemical and electrochemical properties among the other conditions used.},

abstract = {HYPOTHESIS The electrostatic initiation of a jet from the meniscus of a polymeric solution is a key step in near-field electrospinning (NFES), however this process is not sufficiently understood to determine a criterion for the critical emitter voltage triggering the jet, nor to optimize the electrodes. It is expected that the jet initiation in NFES is similar to that in cone-jet electrosprays, and can be described with a first principles model. EXPERIMENTS The electrostatic jet initiation of an SU-8 polymeric solution is studied with two different electrode geometries to quantify the initiation parameters and illustrate the optimization of the electric field. A first-principles model is developed to predict and analyze the initiation. FINDINGS Two jet emission mechanisms are identified: one in which the jet is ejected from a free-standing conical meniscus; and one resulting from the contact of the meniscus with the collector, as it evolves from a spherical to a conical shape. Both are triggered by a critical emitter potential. The former produces the thinnest jets with a diameter that depends on the properties of the fluid, while the latter is an alternative to existing mechanical initiation methods. The model reproduces well the experimental phenomena including the critical voltage.},
